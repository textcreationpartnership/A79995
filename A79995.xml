         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THrice noble Sir, whom not Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath honored with greateſt dignity of higheſt Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but the God of Glory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath dignified, as with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Intereſts in his ſpeciall Grace and Favour in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant meaſure of the ſaving Graces of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, ſo with a glorious and proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in all your weighty undertakings; let it not ſeem overmuch boldneſs in me who am a ſtranger to you by face, that I ſend forth this following
<pb facs="tcp:166430:3"/> Diſcourſe into the world, under the ſhadow of your Lordſhips Name. It ſeemeth, according to our beſt intelligence here, that the ſubject of this Diſcourſe, beginning to grow the great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal buſineſs of theſe polemick times, your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with ſome other of the Lords Worthies in <hi>England,</hi> have expreſſed ſome deſire of yours, that ſomething might be ſpoken thereunto: Now I having begun to do ſomething that way former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (though the moſt unworthy of any ſuch reſpect from ſuch choice Favourites of the Lord) being often moved by ſome of our honoured Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and reverend Elders here, to preſent it to publique view, I began to conclude, that it might be now ſeaſonable, ſo to do; And although I were a very babe in compariſon of others, for abilities and wiſdom to manage ſo weighty a cauſe of the Lord; yet I remembred him that ſaid, <hi>Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings thou haſt ordained ſtrength, that thou mighteſt ſtill the voice of the enemy and the avenger;</hi> ſo that I was incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not alone to put forth this diſcourſe, but to make uſe of your Lordſhips Name therein.

You (truly noble, and valiant Sir) have quit your ſelf like a man of God, in managing your Military weapons, in defence of the Civill State in <hi>England,</hi> againſt all oppoſers of them, for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary acts of Juſtice, which they did, both upon delinquent Stateſmen, and (as they are called) Churchmen too; even the Prelates, and their reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: Yea you have to your utmoſt, in your Military way, managed that cauſe, at firſt covenanted by the State, which was, not alone the bringing of all ſorts of Delinquents to their condign puniſhment, but the reforming of matters of Religion in <hi>Engl</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God, &amp; the pattern of the pureſt Churches: wherfore (right worthy Sir) what you have fought ſo many bloody battels for in the field, now ſtand couragiouſly, and plead ſtoutly for it in peace. <hi>Iſraels</hi> General <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was not more famous for his proweſs &amp; victories over the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in the field,
<pb facs="tcp:166430:4"/> than for his care of ſetling Religion in the people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods mind, when the War was ended; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thoſe memorable paſſages that way, recorded <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 24. King <hi>David</hi> is renowned for the like care, who after the inhabitants of the land were given into his hand, and the land was ſubdued before the Lord and his people, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſet your hearts and ſouls to ſeek the Lord your God, and ariſe and build his Sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c.

Yea, but could not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> deſtroy them by his own immediate hand, and is not his Truth and Word of force to overthrow all that is contrary to it? Yea verily, yet is it the will and pleaſure of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by humane, externall, forcible means, to reſtrain, and puniſh ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors in matters of Religion; wherefore, neither the State, nor Souldiery of <hi>England,</hi> have any cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their Covenant Ingagements, in their ſeveral reſpective ways, to endeavour the bringing it about, that Religion there may be reformed according to the Word of God, and the beſt patterns of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Churches. Nor hath the State of <hi>England</hi> any cauſe to retract any wholſom penall Laws which they have made the 2. of <hi>May</hi> 48. or ſince, againſt ſo many blaſphemous, and falſe Doctrines, and corrupt Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in matters of Religion, mentioned in thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall worthy Laws. Nor hath either State or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery any cauſe to condemn their own renowned acts of Zeal for the Lord, in ſome exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which accordingly they have already inflicted upon ſome perſons for ſuch like offences; but they
<pb facs="tcp:166430:5"/> ſhall aſſuredly find it good, to be alwayes zealous in a good thing. And as they have begun to ſhew themſelves, to be indeed with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not againſt him, ſo to continue, and go on, in deſpite of all falſe, or malignant ſpirits or tongues. And as for you (moſt Noble Sir) who in your Military way, have had ſo many Military diſputes for the Cauſes of the Lord, if it be vile to be for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be you yet more vile, only ſtill keeping (as through Grace you have done hitherto) low in your own eyes; ſo ſhall you at length, after you have ſtood, and in your way alſo have fought for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Cauſe, com to receive that incorruptible Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give you at that day; and not to you onely, but to all thoſe which love his appearing: Which ſhall be ever his prayer who is, Sir,</p>

That Great Antichriſts maſter-piece was, in the firſt place, to ham-ſtring Civil powers from having any thing to do in matters of Religion, or of the Church, further than as ſervants, and indeed vaſſals, unto the Pope, as viſible Head of the Church, or to the Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or at leaſt to Church, Councils and Synods, to execute onely their Decrees and Laws: But ſince that Civil powers have broken thoſe curſed bonds of Antichriſt, and ſhook off that tyrannical yoke of that man of ſin, and have through grace ſeen it their approved dignity from the Lord, and duty to him, to improve their Civil Authority to the utmoſt, againſt that man of ſin, and all his uſurpations and inventions, Satan ſtirreth up others to proſecute the ſame deſign, inſubſtance, albeit, under more ſpecious pretences, even to deſpoil Civil powers of that which is their glory and crown, even as Civil powers, to ſerve the Lord Jeſus, their Lord, and to improve their Authority, to eſtabliſh his Laws and Government onely, within their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to root out whatſoever oppoſeth, and undermineth the ſame. The Devils name is <hi>Belial,</hi> one without yoke, at leaſt, in his deſire and indeavor, and he breatheth that maſterleſs, licentious ſpirit in ſuch as he effectually worketh. They were children of <hi>Belial,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:166430:6"/> ſayd of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>How ſhall this man ſave us?</hi> and they deſpiſed him, and brought him no preſents; thence that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Speech of theirs of old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. <hi>Our tongues are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> we will maintain, hold and ſay what we pleaſe, without controul from any; this Spirit was in <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, who at once contemned and condemned thoſe two main Ordinances of God, Magiſtracy and Miniſtry; they were Levellers, they would have none in office above others, in the Common-wealth or in the Church. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>They gather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaying unto them, ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congregation is holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them, wherefore then lift you up your ſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?</hi> the ſelf ſame ſpirit, <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, ſhall be in ſome licentious Preachers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, who ſhall <hi>turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, Jude</hi> 4. <hi>Walk after their own luſts,</hi> ver. 16. and ver. 8. <hi>Deſpiſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and ſpeak evill of dignities;</hi> namely, not ſo much of perſons in Office, in Church or Common-wealth, as of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Offices; and ver. 11. <hi>They periſh in the gain-ſaying of</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:166430:6"/> worth and power, by others, that they have little left but the bare title and name of ſuch; if the Magiſtrate be allowed by ſome, his power in matters of the ſecond Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the other half of his politicall power in matters of the firſt Table, he may not aſſume. Religious States may not, they think in wiſdom, tolerate State errours and the ventings of them; but if dangerous errours in Religion are ſcattered and ſpread, they muſt let them alone. As if civill maxims were more near and dear to Chriſt, under whom Magiſtrates rule, than the matters of his own ſacred truth; or that matters in politiques, were more blisfull or fatall to their Chriſtian ſubjects, than thoſe in Religion, or that Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Magiſtrates ſhould leave that at a looſe end, (even mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſound doctrine) which is the very bond of Chriſtian ſocieties under their power; bodily murtherers they will yield, muſt be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitally puniſhed, but if the Wine of Intoxicating and Infatuating doctrine of errour, vented and broached by corrupt members of <note place="margin">

And if at a dead lift, Magistratical power, be, with much ado permitted to come within the range and reach of the first Table, yet they will have it under ſo ſhort a tether, and lay ſuch ſtrong chains and heavy bolts upon it, that its there rather as in its priſon, than any way as in its privileged place; they ſhall be permitted to puniſh Witches, Sorcerers, and Inchanters, elſe ſay they, what miſchiefs will befal our Estates, Families, and Bodies?

            <head>A Diſcourſe concerning the Nature and Latitude of Civil Powers in matters of Religion.</head>
            <p>IF ever it were a time, wherein the Zeal of Gods houſe ſhould burn in the hearts of the ſincere members of Jeſus Chriſt; or if ever the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the flaming forth of that holy fire, in their zealous expreſſions and actions (according to their ſeveral places and callings) in way of vindication of the Lords abuſed Name, Truth, Ordinances and Wayes, ſurely this is that time; when under pretence of Spirituall Light, ſo much helliſh darkneſſe beginneth to overſpread the face of the Churches of Chriſt. Wherefore before that I do enter upon the main point which I intend in this Diſcourſe, I ſhall firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a memorable example, of ſuch holy zeal in our Head Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Intent, that ſuch of his Members, who are by office and place moſt concerned therein, may in the fear of God wiſely and ſeriouſly ponder, whether that holy Zeal which was in Jeſus Chriſt, as in a Well-head, and is doubtleſſe (in their meaſures) derived to them alſo, ſhould not now be more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly exerted and exerciſed that way.</p>
            <p>The example I intend is recorded in Joh. 2. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>And Ieſus went up to Jeruſalem. And found in the Temple thoſe that ſold oxen, and ſheep, and Doves, and the changers of money, ſitting. And when he had made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, he drove them all out of the Temple, with the ſheep and the oxen, and poured out the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers money, and overthrew the tables. And ſaid to them that ſold Doves, Take theſe things hence, make not my Fathers houſe an houſe of Merchandiſe. And his Diſciples remembred that it was</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:166430:10"/> 
               <hi>written, The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> This Hiſtory of Chriſts purging the Temple, being the relation of one of his moſt glorious Acts, in which he put forth his hand in publique view, after his moſt ſolemn entrance upon his great work: It is the more obſervable, and doth call for more then ordinary Improvement, by all ſuch, whoſe property it is as Saints, to make narrow ſearch into all the great Works, as of God a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <note place="margin">Pſal. 111. 2.</note> ſo of Jeſus Chriſt God-man their Redeemer: but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all ſuch, whoſe duty it is by their office and place, to be Reformers of matters amiſſe in the houſe of the Lord. Twice at leaſt (it is clear) Chriſt acts thus, once in the beginning of his Miniſtry, as John noteth in this Chapter: and another time towards the end thereof, as the other Evangeliſts ſhew, Matth. 21. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Mark 11. 15, 16, 17. Luke 19. 37. to 47. Jeſus Chriſt then when acting his publick Miniſtry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, he made it one of his firſt, ſo one of his laſt works to reform matters amiſſe in Religion. At firſt, buyers of oxen and ſheep are outed the Temple; but at laſt, ſellers too. At firſt Dove-ſellers are gently ſpoken to, to carry away their Truck, but at laſt their ſeats alſo are overthrown. Chriſt ſaith at firſt, <hi>you have made my Fathers houſe an houſe of Merchandiſe;</hi> but at laſt, <hi>ye have made it a den of theeves.</hi> He is then more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere at a ſecond time, againſt ſuch who reform not by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer check.</p>
            <p>If any enquire after the time when this was: It was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon Chriſts firſt coming to Jeruſalem, after his ſolemn Initiation into his office, Joh. 2. 11, 12, 13. compared. If any ask what the occaſion of this Act was, It is noted in that, he <hi>found in the Temple thoſe that ſold oxen,</hi> &amp;c. if any would know in what manner he Acted; that alſo is expreſſed; with ſome he dealeth by blowes; violently driving them out with his ſcourge made of ſmall cords: ſo that the Inſtrument he maketh uſe of to correct them in ſuch ſort, is a whip or ſcourge: the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials thereof were ſmall cords; namely, which thoſe traders brought with their Cattel: with this ſcourge ſo made, he layeth on ſo violently, that he driveth out not ſo much the beaſts, as the Beaſt-ſellers alſo; he drave them all out, and the ſheep and the oxen, or with the ſheep and the oxen; which the Greek text cleareth, uſing the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in reference to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as alſo to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Beaſt-ſellers, and money-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:166430:10"/> If any would demand the ground why Chriſt did thus: It is given partly in that himſelf ſpake; <hi>Make not [my Fathers houſe] an houſe of Merchandize.</hi> It was his Fathers houſe which was ſo profaned and polluted; and he, as his ſon, is nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; and partly in that which the Spirit of God ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſeaſonably to the Diſciples from the Book of Pſalmes; <hi>The Zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now may not the Saints learn for their Inſtruction ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things hence, which concern them alſo, even all of them in their ſeveral callings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially thoſe in higher place? Yes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
            <p>From a more general Conſideration of this hiſtory, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, the dealing of Jeſus Chriſt, with ſinners amongſt his people: we may all note, that which godly Interpreters hint hence to us.</p>
            <p>As from this that is ſaid, he found ſuch and ſuch, and dealt ſo with them:</p>
            <p>Learn firſt, That the ſight and aſſured knowledg of ſinnes acted, eſpecially by perſons pretending to Religion, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh the Lord Jeſus ſome way or other to expreſſe his deep diſpleaſure againſt them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſometimes the Lord Jeſus dealeth with ſinners, and puniſheth them in the very Act of ſinning; as he ſcourged them here, which he took in the manner.</p>
            <p>From what is here ſaid; he took ſmall cords and made a whip thereof, even of the very Cords, which they ſinfully abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bring their Cattel into a forbidden place for any ſuch uſe:</p>
            <p>Learn, that ſometimes the Lord Jeſus maketh puniſhing ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for ſinners, even of the very inſtruments themſelves, abuſed to ſinne.</p>
            <p>From the manner of Chriſts dealing here, that with his whip he driveth out the beaſt-ſellers, as the beaſts, uſing them therein as their beaſts; Learn that ſuch as under the means of grace, groſly abuſe and prophane the ſame, they are of baſeſt eſteem in the ſight of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, theſe abuſes were not without religious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture grounds: God had of old ſaid, Deut. 14. 24. 25, 26. <hi>If the way be too long for thee, ſo that thou art not able to carry it, (namely, the tythe of their corn and firſtlings of their flock which they</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:166430:11"/> 
               <hi>were to eate before the Lord,</hi> v. 23.) <hi>Or if the place be too far from thee which the Lord thy God ſhal chuſe to ſet his name there:</hi> (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was Jeruſalem and the Temple there) <hi>then ſhalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the mony in thy hand, and ſhalt go to the place which the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe: And thou ſhalt beſtow that money for whatſoever thy ſoul luſteth after, for Oxen or for ſheep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou ſhalt eat it before the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. It might therefore ſeem convenient to have the beaſts at hand to be ſold there where they were to be uſed; beſides every one was to offer half a ſhekel after the ſhekel of the Sanctaurie, to make attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their ſouls; Exodus 30. 13, 14, 15. and were it not convenient to have ſome money changers, to have ſo many hundred thouſand ſuch like pieces in readineſs for each one that needed them, who though they might have either greater or leſſer pieces, yet poſſibly not ſuch as weighed neither more nor leſſe then half the ſhekel of the Sanctuarie. But yet for all ſuch pretended conveniences and ſeemingly good ends propounded, thoſe abuſes were ſo diſtaſted and corrected by Jeſus Chriſt: And may not all thence learn;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That good ends propounded or pretended, cannot juſtifie actions ſeemingly good, but really bad, nor exempt the Actours of them from the check and ſcourge of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſuch are in ſpecial wiſe diſtaſted and deteſted by the Lord Jeſus, who under religious pretences corrupt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>From the ground expreſſed which moved Chriſt to do thus, in that through their covetouſneſs his Fathers houſe deſigned to holy ends and uſes, is perverted to common and prophane uſes: Learn:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That worldlineſſe or covetouſneſſe is, and hath ever been wont to be the common inlet of corruptions in Religion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they pretended for this Temple trading, the gain of their merchandize is intended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That worldly and covetous profeſſours of Religion are of vile account with Jeſus Chriſt; he whippeth them as he doth their beaſts out of the Temple. From this Hiſtorie conſidered with more ſpecial reference to Reformation of things amiſſe in the Lords houſe; and therein from the circumſtance of the time when Jeſus Chriſt acted thus in way of purging the Temple even upon his firſt ſolemn coming into publike view at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166430:11"/> after his actual entrance upon his publike work: may not we learn,</p>
            <p>That Reformation of things amiſſe in Religion are very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and as in the firſt place to be ſet about, by ſuch as are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called of God?</p>
            <p>From the occaſion of what Chriſt here did, he found matters at ſo bad a paſſe in the Temple: may not we learn</p>
            <p n="1">1. That corruptions in matters of Religion are very apt to creep into true Churches, and being once let in, to be connived at, and tolerated? Theſe abuſes were of long ſtanding, and notwithſtanding thoſe whoſe charge it was to have looked bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to it, yet Chriſt when he came into the Temple, he findeth ſuch corruptions there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That when ſuch as are called to redreſſe things amiſſe in religion, doe groſly neglect their dutie therein; the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is wont ſome way or other to put forth his hand, in purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſame, when the Prieſts rather further then hinder theſe corruptions, and civil authoritie ſuffered the ſame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; then cometh Jeſus Chriſt with his whip and purgeth the Temple.</p>
            <p>From the manner of Chriſts purging the Temple: Learn;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Church Reformers work, may in ſome particulars thereof be ſometimes deſpicable, but yet is never diſdained by perſons truely gracious. Chriſt with his own hand refuſeth not to gather up ſmall cords to make a whip of them, and with it to drive out men and beaſts out of the Temple. Reformers work is in Scripture language, Refiners, Fullers, Hedgers, Vine-dreſſers, Shepheards, Sink-cleanſers work, yet very acceptable to Godly ones.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Reformations of things amiſſe in Religion, are to be carried on with expreſſions of greateſt indignation and diſtaſte, as of the abuſes themſelves, ſo of the inſtruments, and of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances thereof, hence Jeſus Chriſt uſed a ſcourge: hence ſuch diſtaſte of his expreſſed againſt the very Oxen and Sheep ſo abuſed: hence alſo his overthrowing the money-changers tables, and pouring their money upon the ground. Beſides the uſe of Chriſts whip was both an outward means of forcible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and puniſhment of theſe abuſes in Religion; and that in reſpect to perſons themſelves, who were chief actours therein; for Chriſt violently drave out them alſo with his whip; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166430:12"/> therefore Matthew relating this act of Chriſt as renewed a ſecond time, Matth. 21. 12, 13. He onely mentioneth Chriſts caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out both all them that ſold, and all them that bought in the Temple; and the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, uſed there and here denoteth ſome ſpecial violence, he caſt them out as a ſtone out of a ſling, the word is oft uſed in Scripture to expreſſe ſome violent way of dealing. Its frequently uſed in Matthew, Chapter 8. and 9. and 10. and 12. <hi>for caſting out of Devils;</hi> Its uſed <hi>for caſting out the unprepared gueſt into outer darkneſſe,</hi> Matthew 22. 13. and <hi>for caſting out the unprofitable ſervant,</hi> Matthew 25. 30. and <hi>for caſting out the bond-woman and her ſonne,</hi> Gal. 4. 30. and <hi>for expelling of Paul and Barnabas,</hi> Acts 13. 50. &amp;c. And may not this Act of Jeſus Chriſt thus forcibly reſtraining and puniſhing theſe abuſes in perſons manifeſtly guiltie thereof, afford this inſtruction alſo, as clearly deducible thence?</p>
            <p>That corruptions in religion, outwardly breaking forth, and expreſſed, they may, yea, and muſt be reſtrained and puniſhed by ſuch as are thereunto called.</p>
            <p>Now this being a point of much weight, and (albeit abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly atteſted and confirmed by Scripture) yet now adayes too too much diſreliſhed and oppoſed, I ſhall God willing propound it to further conſideration and diſquiſition. Onely before I leave this conſiderable and memorable example of Chriſts zeal this way; It will not be amiſſe to ſet down the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſundry godly learned writers touching the way and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect wherein it may be ſaid Chriſt did act thus, and how farre forth this Act herein is preſidential or imitable.</p>

               <hi>Pareus</hi> upon Matthew 21. 12, 13. (where the ſecond time of Chriſts purging the Temple is recorded) ſaith, <q>This exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be drawn into imitation by every private man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can in no wiſe ſay, that the Temple is their houſe; but ſuch to whom the houſe of God is given and commended by vertue of their Office: As are Princes, and Paſtours, and Governours of the Church, who as they are to governe the Church according to the word, ſo alſo in caſe of abuſes creeping in, ſhould they reform the ſinne; onely according to the word.</q>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166430:12"/> ones hand, private perſons, and ſuch as are not in publicke authoritie, are rather to oppoſe it with their tongue, and to ſigh and crie before the Lord till he afford remedie thereof: he denieth it as imitable by private, but yields it as imitable by ſuch as are in publick authoritie.</q>

It is anſwered, ſaith he, that by this example is ſhewed that abuſes even in externals are by all means to be reformed; in which matter godly Magiſtrates are to lend their help to the Miniſters, that as they by preaching, ſo Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates may even by external repurgation remove thoſe things which are repugnant to the regular worſhip of God. But as for that Chriſt did, it appertaineth not ſo much to his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, as to his Kingly.</q>

               <q>Maſter <hi>Dyke</hi> writing upon this fact of Chriſts purging the Temple, and having declared how this fact of Chriſt was not imitable, as Chriſt did thus as the Sonne of God; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this queſtion, how far forth this fact of Chriſt is imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</q>

Then he ſheweth how Miniſters in their way of preaching are to doe thus, and then how pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men in their way of prayer and ſighings (but not by other violence) are to be doing this way.</q>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166430:13"/> found in the Temple, as ſoon as Chriſt came into the citie, (ſaith he) he viſiteth the Temple. This ſhould be the firſt care of all godly ones, not of Paſtours onely, but of all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates whatſoever, that the Kingdome and worſhip of God be ſought after. And upon that, and when he had made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, he caſt them all out together with the Sheep and the Oxen; he obſerveth we ſee by this fact of Chriſt how diſtaſteful they are, and how unſufferable in the Church, who under pretence of divine worſhip exerciſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize. Doubtleſſe there were many other crimes, by which God was commonly provoked; and yet we reade not that Chriſt uſed like ſeveritie againſt them; but forthwith he caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this loathſome plague of ſuch Merchandize out of the Temple. Who ſeeth not hence that thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Glory and Worſhip of God are not alone before all other things, but with greateſt ſeveritie to be purged away, and that not without cauſe, ſince in theſe ſinne is committed againſt the firſt Table, and under pretence of Divine worſhip, ſervice is done to the Devil and to worldly luſts; and beſide the plague which ariſeth here ſpreadeth into the whole body more ſpeedily and dangerouſly then can be imagined. Again, let ſuch who would have nothing done in a compulſive way againſt Idolaters and corrupters of Gods worſhip in the Church, but thinke ſuch as doe evil are to be intreated willingly to deſiſt: let ſuch anſwer, Why Chriſt did not here doe thus; why he did not meekly requeſt theſe merchants to carrie their Oxen and Sheep, and money out of the Temple; None ſay they are by force to be compelled to godlineſſe; be it ſo, but are they not by force to be reſtrained, yea and driven away, who exerciſe gainfull trades in the Temple; what ſhall we ſay that Chriſt here ſinned? God forbid! he compelled them not to Pietie, yet he caſteth that merchandize out of the Temple. Furthermore, they have hence ground to change their opinion who teach, that external evils in the Church, are not to be taken away, unleſs they be firſt taken out of mens hearts? for according to this Doctrine, Chriſt ſhould firſt have caſt that inward evil of covetouſneſſe out of the Jewes hearts, and then have caſt them out of the Temple; but we ſee it quite otherwiſe in what Chriſt did here, he caſt theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants out of the Temple, although they kept their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:166430:13"/> ſtill in their hearts: giving hence an example, whereby he might teach us, that publick evil is not to be ſuffered in the Church, although it cannot be rooted out of mens hearts. If any reply, It is but vain to remove it out of the Church, if it be not removed out of the hearts of men; ſurely (ſaith he) Chriſt knew this well enough, yet he did his office, having made a ſcourge, he hunted theſe dogs out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Snecanus</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Magiſtratu,</hi> he maketh uſe of this example of Chriſts purging the Temple with a ſcourge in his hand, to prove the Magiſtrates power now under the Goſpel, in matters of both tables.</p>

Yet I acknowledge this power put forth by Miniſters of the Word, was in them extraordinary, and the manner of exerciſing it after a ſort divine: but I prove, that though the Lord doth not alwayes make uſe of the help of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, yet in all ages, he doth make uſe of the Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Magiſtrate is the onely ordinary Miniſter, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as himſelf ſeeth it meet, for the preſervation of his Church.</q>

What Chriſt did here immediately, as an act appertaining to his Soveraignty, to purge out Church corruptions, he now doth by his Vicegerents hands, mediately.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is anſwered; he that was God and man, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> acted did act thus in a mixt way, not onely as God, but partly alſo as Man: as man he gathered up the ſmall cords, as man he twiſted them, and made a ſcourge of them; as man he laid on with his bodily hand in ſuch ſort, as thereby to drive the beaſt-ſellers out of the Temple: herein therefore imitable, in ſuch mere humane acts, by men of place. Like acts for ſubſtance, were put forth by David, a man of place, (before Chriſts coming in the fleſh) and if typical in David, yet verified partly in Chriſt as the ſon of David; and ſo as man. Yea the reaſon here ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the Holy Ghoſt to the Diſciples, as juſtifying Chriſts act, namely the zeal of Gods houſe, Joh. 2. 17. it muſt needs be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be an apt, and juſt reaſon ſuitable to the act: as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore is appliable to Chriſt as man, the Antitype, even as it was to David the type: ſo is the Act grounded upon that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and juſtified by it, in the ſame way appliable to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type Chriſt, as to the type David. Chriſt could have caſt out theſe out of the Temple, by a word of his mouth, as he did caſt Devils out of living temples, of his peoples bodies: or as he caſt down thoſe who came to take him, Joh. 18. or he could by a Judicial cord have puniſhed them ſpiritually; as when he bid them fillup the meaſure of their fathers ſins, Matth. 23. 32. but he choſe to act in ſuch a humane way, imitable by others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto called.</p>

                  </label> outward reſtraint and puniſhment of abuſes in Religion, muſt needs be in it ſelf, that whereon the Image of Chriſts zeal is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamped; that which is in it ſelf good, and allowed of God in ſpecial wiſe; (for elſe Chriſt could not at all have acted thus, without ſin,) and if in it ſelf it be of that nature, why not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:166430:14"/> by ſuch as are thereto called of God, to do that in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, which he did in an extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Be it that it were extraordinary in Chriſt as man, to act thus; ſo was <hi>Phinehas</hi> his act of killing <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> Numb. 25. 7, 8. and Samuels, in hewing Agag in pieces, 1 Sam. 15. 33. and Elijahs ſlaughter which he made among Baals Prieſts, 1 King. 18. 40. yet it muſt be yeelded, that there muſt be ſome, who by office might, and ſhould, in an ordinary way, have puniſhed ſuch filthineſſe, murthers, or Idolatries; the Lord not uſing to ſtirre up any, to an extraordinary way, to do any ſuch like acts, but in the defect of acts of ordinary power: and ſo here; the ſame Spirit which ſtirred up them to ſupply that defect of the acting of ordinary power, by extraordinary motions and acts; did alſo ſtir up Jeſus Chriſt, in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, to reſtrain and puniſh theſe corruptions in Religion, which the preſent Civil power, in duty unto the Lord, as his Miniſters, ought to have reſtrained and puniſhed; and ſo to have revenged the Indignity therein done to the Lord, whoſe houſe was ſo profaned. According to that Rom. 13. 4. but they failing in their duty this way, the ſame Spirit of zeal that ſtirred up David his type, in the corrupter times of Saul, to be vindicating ſuch indignities againſt the Lord, ſtirred up Chriſt his Antitype, to do like work for ſubſtance, in thoſe corrupter times, upon which he was caſt. Nor was this an extraordinary ſupply of the defect of ordinary Miniſterial and Prieſtly power, conſidered as Prieſtly and Miniſterial: for what had they to do, as ſuch, with external and corporal reſtraint, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any ordinary way: in that way, if Peter uſe the ſword, he muſt periſh by it, Matth. 26. 52. but it muſt needs be a ſupply of the defect of Magiſtratical power, which in an ordinary way, maketh uſe of the ſword, or whip, or like inſtruments of corporeal puniſhment, and vengeance, Rom. 13. 4. rather then ſuch like abuſes in Religion ſhall not be, in an external coercive way, curbed and puniſhed, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf will do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary to ſupply that defect. So far is that from being Moſaical, Jewiſh, and much leſſe tyrannical work, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to reſtrain and puniſh ſuch abuſes in Religion, for which yet conſcience to the Word might be pretended, (as that Law Deut. 14. 24. 25, 26. might be for theſe) that Jeſus Chriſt thought it fit to become himſelf, to put forth his hand, to ſo good and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:166430:15"/> bleſſed a Work, when thoſe whoſe duty it was to do it, would not diſcharge their truſt.</p>
               <p>And now having thus far waded, to find out ſome part of Gods Counſel, in this famous Hiſtory of Chriſts purging the Temple; I ſhall leave the ſame to the Judgment of the godly wiſe.</p>
               <p>The Theſis and Poſition, which I ſhall propound to be cleared and confirmed from the Scriptures, ſhall be that, which before I hinted, namely,</p>
               <p>That Corruptions in Religion, outwardly breaking forth and expreſſed, may, yea and muſt be reſtrained and puniſhed, by ſuch as are called thereunto.</p>
               <p>Now for the better Handling, and the more full diſcovery of the truth of this point; we ſhall firſt propound ſome diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. Lay down ſome concluſions about it. 3. Confirm the point from Scripture. 4. Draw three or four Corrolaries thence.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Corruptions in Religion are either Dogmatical, or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. And theſe again, are either ſuch as are more groſſe, and ſtrike at the very fundamentals, or vitals of Religion, whether directly or collaterally; or ſuch as are of a more circumſtantial and lighter nature.</p>
               <p>Again; Corruptions in Religion, are either ſuch as are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly taken up, and imbraced, and ſo kept cloſe in the minds and hearts of perſons; or ſuch as come under mans kenne and view: being outwardly expreſſed in word, writing, Action, or the like. And theſe again which come thus into open view, are either ſuch as are held forth with meekneſſe, peaceableneſſe, and real expreſſions of cordial readineſſe to lay them aſide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, upon better information; or ſuch as are carried on in any inſolent, and turbulent way; or with expreſſions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Civil, or Church order.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reſtraint and puniſhment of theſe, is, either that which is merely and immediately divine, or that which is mixt, partly divine, partly humane, in reſpect either of the agent, or manner of Acting; or that which is properly in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the act, perſon, and manner of Acting, Humane. And this is either Political, which is carried on in a civil way, and by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:166430:15"/> political means; or Eccleſiaſtical, which is carried on in a Church way, and by Eccleſiaſtical meanes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Call of God, to reſtrain and puniſh abuſes, is, either immediately Divine, as when by divine viſion, revelation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, inſpiration, inſtinct, and the like: or that which is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately divine, in reſpect of God the Authour, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane, in reſpect of man deſigning and inviting.</p>
               <p>Now let us in the ſecond place lay down ſome Concluſions: 1. Negatively; what may not be done this way. 2. Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; what may and muſt.</p>
               <p>In a negative way we ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No private perſon now, in theſe dayes, under any pretence whatſoever, may take upon him to reſtrain and puniſh Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in Religion, in thoſe who are not under his perſonal charge. Calls which are immediately Divine, are now ceaſed; men are now to look for a call from man; and by man to act in way of reſtraining and puniſhing the faults of others which are not under them, either as Parents, Guardians, Maſters, Tutors, or the like. It is raſh zeal; zeal without knowledge, to do any thing that way, without the bounds of ones particular calling; in the limits whereof, every one ſhould abide with God, 1 Cor. 7. 20, 24. It tendeth to confuſion in Churches and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; and God is no Author of that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33.</p>
               <p>In thoſe dayes, when God was pleaſed to give forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extraordinary Calls to ſuch work: yet thoſe zealous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites await their call from him, whoſe proper work it was, in a forcible and corporal way, to puniſh ſuch abuſes; even from Moſes the Magiſtrate, Exod. 32. 26, 27, 28. and Deut. 33. 9. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Uzzahs ſad puniſhment by the Lord (even in thoſe dayes) for putting forth his hand to ſtay the Ark from falling, having not a call thereunto, 1 Chron. 13. 9, 10. is of publick Admonition to all of us, to take heed we break not the bounds of our calling this way; out of a pretence to preſerve Religion from Injuries: he that ſo uſeth the ſword, ſhall periſh by it, Matth. 26. 52, 53.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No Civil Authority whatſoever, nor perſons thereto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">Concluſ. 2.</note> may, as perſons in Civil Authority, curb or puniſh abuſes in Religion, in any Eccleſiaſtical manner, or by meanes properly Eccleſiaſtical; as excommunication or the like. What he who is a godly Ruler may do, conſidered as a member of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:166430:16"/> viſible Church, with joynt concurrence of the Church whereof he is a member, is another caſe. Chriſt never gave the power of the keyes, to any Civil Common Wealths or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as Civil Societies: but to his Church, as an Eccleſiaſtical ſociety, Matth. 16. 18, 19. and chap. 18. 17, 18. 1 Cor. 5. 4. nor on the other hand may Churches, or Church Officers, take upon them to reſtrain, ſentence, or puniſh Church abuſes, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in any external, forcible way, or by any corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Impriſonments, Fines, Mulcts, Stripes, Sword, Whip, Fire, Faggot, or the like. And in vain do the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> in their gloſſe upon that Scripture in Joh. 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. plead for their Father the Pope, as having ground from thence, to make uſe of both ſwords, the temporal and the ſpiritual ſword; Even Peter himſelf, whoſe Succeſſour he falſly pleadeth to be, he may not uſe the temporal ſword: no not when pretending zeal in the cauſe of Chriſt, his Maſter, but is chidden, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt for it, Matth. 26. 52. the Church of Rome, and all her Officers, muſt ſubject themſelves to Civil Authority; and if they themſelves do any manifeſt evil, they are to fear the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſword, Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. which with the reſt of the Epiſtle is directed to the Church at Rome, Chap. 1. 7. the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary uſe of the Whip and Sword, is a Lordly and Maſterly Act; it is one exerciſe of a Lordly Dominion and Authority; and it may not be ſo with Peter, or any other of Chriſts Apoſtles, or their Succeſſours, Matth. 20. 25, 26. where if the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, would be evaded as underſtood of any tyrannical uſe of ſuch power; Luke in his 22 Chapter, verſe 25. taketh off all ſcruple; when he ſaith of the Kings of the Gentiles, that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they barely exerciſe Lordſhip and authority over you, namely in their Civil way: he addeth, verſ. 26. <hi>but it ſhall not be ſo with you:</hi> you may not imitate them, in any ſuch uſe or exerciſe of their power. Nor was the Queſtion moved to Chriſt, by the Diſciples, who ſhould be tyrants over the reſt, but, who ſhould have Dominion over the reſt: to which Chriſt anſwereth, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither Civil, nor Church power may curb, or puniſh, a mere ſuppoſed Corruption in Religion, but that which is ſo really, and manifeſtly appearing from grounds of the Word: the contrary is condemned, when men are made offendors for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:166430:16"/> a word rightly uttered by the juſt, Eſay 29. 21. when Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ſhall ignorantly and raſhly paſſe cenſures, out of a bare ſuppoſal of ſervice therein done to Chriſt, Joh. 16. 2, 3. <hi>they that kill you ſhall think they do God good ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither the one power, nor the other, may cenſure and puniſh real corruptions in Religion, till breaking forth into outward expreſſion, and brought into more open view: for then they are Judicially certain, then they are of legal proof: then they are ſcandalous and Infectious. Hence that Law about civil puniſhing corruptions in Religion, Deut. 13. 13, 14 and 17. 2, 3, 4, 5. If it be told unto thee, and thou haſt heard it, then ſhalt thou enquire diligently, and if it be true, and the thing certain, that ſuch abomination is wrought in Iſrael, then ſhalt thou bring forth that man or woman, and ſtone them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though ſuch as are in place may be, and ſhould be in a holy wiſe jealous, and carry a more watchful eye, in caſe of hints given of ſuch corruptions, as creeping in amongſt them; as were the heads of the Tribes upon ſome information given, touching a new Altar made by the two Tribes and half, Joſh. 22. 11, 12, 13, 14. and as was Paul in his way of the Church of Corinth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. yet is it not meet by any external vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means, as by Oathes <hi>ex officio,</hi> cloſe Impriſonments, wracks, Strappadoes, and other prepoſterous wayes of Inquiſition, to bring that under Cenſure, which Gods providence ripeneth not for it. Neither Claudius Lyſias the Centurion, nor Felix, nor after him Feſtus the Governour of the Jewes, would any of them uſe any ſuch wayes, to extort ſelf-accuſations (ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the light of Nature, and Law of Nations,) from Paul, a ſuppoſed and accuſed Delinquent many wayes. See Act. 22. 30. and 23. 28, 29, 30, 35. and 24. 22, 23. and 25. 5, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Although the Corruptions in Religion, may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt either to the Civil, or Church Court, yet not actually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, till ſufficient meanes of conviction be uſed. Thus did the Heads of the ten Tribes, although preparing to ſtrike and puniſh that Innovation and new way of Religion, (as was ſuppoſed) yet what effectual meanes they did uſe of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may appear by that gracious ſpeech made to the two tribes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:166430:17"/> and half, by their Meſſengers, Joſh. 22. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. verſes compared. So in Church Courts, an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick muſt be rejected, but yet not till after once, or twice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Although neither powers Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical, may inforce upon Aliens from the true Religion, any of the wayes of it, yet may not the Civil power ſuffer Aliens, either openly to vilifie or blaſpheme the true Religion, or to abaſe the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and profeſſours thereof, or any way to diſturb them in the holy exerciſe of it. Chriſt would not ſuffer the man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, to make diſturbance in the Sabbath ſolemnities, but caſteth out the devil, Mark 1. Or leaſt of all may they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to practiſe openly their Jewiſh, or Pagan Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Neither Powers may equally cenſure or correct all ſorts of corruptions in Religion, which come into publick view: but as the corruptions are more groſſe, or the perſons more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous, and turbulent in their way, ſo to lay on the more load upon them. Some are Seducers and Ringleaders in the offences and abuſes, ſome ſeduced; neither all errours, nor all erring perſons, are of equal guilt, and Juſtice muſt <hi>ſuum cuique tribuere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poſitively we affirm, that both Church Officers with their <note place="margin">Affirmat. Concluſ.</note> Churches, in a Church way, and higheſt Civil Authority and Rulers, in their political way, they may, yea they muſt reſtrain, and ſeaſonably and ſuitably puniſh all groſſer corruptions in Religion, manifeſtly croſſe to the Word, when they are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and openly expreſſed, to the Juſt offence of the Saints, and hurt of others. To explain this a little.</p>
               <p>We ſay, they may do ſo; not as a matter of their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do or not to do ſo; a thing may be lawful, which in caſe is not expedient: but this is a duty to which they are bound, and with which they cannot wholly diſpenſe: its there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added, they muſt do it; oft times indeed they do it not, but in duty they are bound to it: Albeit they may for a time ſometimes ſuſpend the acting of it; yet its added, they muſt ſeaſonably do it: not too ſuddenly, before ſome paines and patience be uſed; nor yet too ſlowly, delaying over-long, till ſuch evils ſpread too far, grow to too ſtrong an head, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:166430:17"/> incurable, or at leaſt uncontroulable. They muſt alſo doe it ſuitably, that is, obſerving proportions of perſons offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of matter, manner, times and places of offence that way. And they muſt ſo deal, not with every lighter matter of offence, but in caſe of groſſer offences, ſtriking at the weightier matters of God, tending to invalidate and undermine, or to invert or pervert his choicer inſtitutions. And they muſt ſo puniſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions manifeſtly croſſe to the word, not matters which in themſelves are meerly diſputable both wayes, but which are in themſelves clearly croſſe to the Word, if not in the expreſſe letter of it, yet in reſpect of concluſions unavoydably, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deducible from the Word.</p>
               <p>It is further added when they are outwardly expreſſed, &amp;c. Namely in word, writing, in geſture or deed; uttering or acting the evils themſelves in an open and offenſive way; or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly and turbulently expreſſing diſtaſte ſome way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the contrary truth and way profeſſed and practiſed by Religious Common-wealths, or by the purer Churches in them.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in theſe latter times ſo many depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doctrines of Devils, and becauſe that civil government is now ſo much deſpiſed, and too many are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities in Kingdomes and Common-wealths, making them uſurpers for medling in ſuch matters of Religion, or for daring to improve their civil power to reſtrain and puniſh ſuch enormities in Religion; I ſhall therefore onely addreſſe my ſelf at preſent to prove and confirm this Poſition; that it is the dutie of higheſt civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and of the civil Rulers in a religious State, to reſtrain and puniſh corruptions and abuſes in religion, breaking forth within their juriſdiction, according as even now explained and ſtated in the foregoing concluſion.</p>
               <p>This I prove by ſeveral reaſons grounded upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> The firſt reaſon hereof is taken from the nature of ſuch work of ſuch political reſtraint and puniſhment; It is a choice piece of ſervice to the Lord from them: therefore no uſurpation; nay rather therefore their dutie: therefore well becomming them.</p>
               <p>When Moſes the chief Magiſtrate would be putting forth his authoritie to call forth ſome as inſtruments of his authoritie,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:166430:18"/> to puniſh by the temporall ſword, thoſe open corruptions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Actours thereof, Exodus 32. 4. &amp;c. verſe 26. He asked, <hi>Who was on the Lords ſide.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Who is for the Lord?</hi> It is therefore in the very nature of the thing to be for the Lord, or on his ſide to puniſh ſuch corruptions in ſuch offenders. And verſe 29. ſpeaking of the ſame work; Moſes authoritatively bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, <hi>Conſecrate your ſelves to day to the Lord, even every man upon his ſonne and upon his brother:</hi> (adding this bleſſed motive to that work) <hi>That he may beſtow a bleſſing upon you to day.</hi> It is in the Hebrew Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Fill your hand;</hi> a phraſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from ſacrifices, and ſuch as offered ſacrifices, or had their hands filled for that end. Hence when Aaron and his ſons are to be conſecrated to the Lord for offering ſacrifice, Exod. 10. 9. It is ſaid in the Hebrew, and thou ſhalt fill the hand of Aaron, and the hand of his ſons. Acts of juſtice againſt enemies to the Church; watching to make advantages of their weakneſſe, as did the Amalekites <hi>They are a choice ſervice and ſacrifice to God, yea, preferred by Samuel before Sacrifice,</hi> 1 Samuel 15. 2. 3. 18. there is Gods charge: And verſe 22. <hi>Obedience to that Charge, is made better then Sacrifice.</hi> Hence when God by others ſword doth puniſh the Churches enemies; Eſay 34. 6. He ſaith of it, <hi>The ſword of the Lord is filled with bloud:</hi> He calleth it his ſword, and addeth, <hi>For the Lord hath a ſacrifice in Bozra, and a great ſlaughter in the land of Idumea.</hi> That Act of juſtice is owned by the Lord as his Sacrifice; and Ezechiel 39. 17. ſpeaking of thoſe grand enemies of his Church, <hi>Gog and Magogs juſt ſlaughter:</hi> He calleth to the Fowles, <hi>Come to my ſacrifice, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this place is the more obſervable, In that the like ſpeech is expreſly applied, when the overthrow of ſuch as follow the whore and beaſt, and falſe Prophet of Rome, in his wayes, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and government; and when the overthrow of all ſuch as ſupport that man of ſinne is deſcribed, Revel. 19. 17, 18, 19. It is there called <hi>The Supper of the great God:</hi> come and gather your ſelves unto the Supper of the great God. So delightfull and contentfull, and pleaſing to the great God, are ſuch acts of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall Juſtice by the civill Sword, upon ſuch as are groſly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in matters of Religion; It is to him as a Sacrifice, as a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>If any ſay that was Old Teſtament, ſurely this is New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Doctrine, and that with Jeſus Chriſt himſelf commended
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:166430:18"/> to John, to communicate to his Churches. If ſuch Acts be in their own Nature acts of perſons for the Lord, or on the Lords ſide, or if as a very acceptable ſacrifice to the Lord, then;</p>
               <p>It is ſo now; would not underminers of Magiſtrates power this way, have godly Magiſtrates for the Lord, and on his ſide now, as well as formerly, or to do him ſuch choice ſervice which may be to him as a very ſacrifice now, as well as then?

This ſword alſo is in ſome reſpect, the ſword of his mouth; for as Supream over all civill powers, he ſentenceth that whore, and beaſt of Rome, with his Adherents, to ſuch a doome to be executed by ſuch as have power under him, and from him, to avenge his quarrells by the Temporall ſword, which onely are civill Magiſtrates, Romans 13. 4. <hi>He giveth the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to them, and biddeth them ſmite:</hi> and the judgement ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; it is the Lords according to the expreſſion, Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie 1. 17. The retinue of Antichriſt, fight not againſt Chriſt, his Lawes and Subjects onely by dogmaticall and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall weapons, or ſuch like: but as Revelation 17. 14.

               <p>And this puniſhment upon perſons ſo corrupt in matters of Religion is in the dayes of the New Teſtament, ſet forth as ſo renowned and acceptable a piece of ſervice to the Lord.

And never but of an externall taking, as with the hand. And indeed ſuch externally forcible taking, muſt needs be moſt proper to the nature of the reſemblance, in that Text of Canticles, which is the taking of the Foxes which ſpoile the Vines. Evident then it is, that this taking of the Foxes there injoyned, is not to be reſtrained to Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers acts, if at all underſtood of them; but muſt be referred to ſuch at leaſt, whoſe place and work it is, to act in an externally forcible way of taking, or of reſtraining and puniſhing ſuch Foxes, which ſpoile the Vines or Churches of Chriſt: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Vines, Pſalm 1.

Some would have theſe Foxes to be errours, hereſies, and other hurtfull offences, againſt the firſt or ſecond Table; which muſt be thus reſtrained and puniſhed, in the Actours and Authours of them.</p>
               <p>Others, underſtand the perſons rather ſo offending, which muſt be ſo taken as Hereticall perſons, blaſphemers, and ſuch like. Whence falſe Prophets compared to Foxes; Ezekiel, 13. 4. Concerning theſe the Churches well beloved; Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles 2. 10. Even <hi>Chriſt the Churches Spouſe, whoſe Dove is the Church;</hi> Verſe 14. He giveth this order; Verſe 15. <hi>Take ye us the Foxes.</hi>

               <p>Whether the ſpeech he utter, were in his own name, as ſome think; or in the name of the bleſſed Father and Spirit alſo: as others think, or whether ſpoken with reſpect had to his Spouſe the Church: <hi>Take ye us;</hi> that is for me and my Church, or for my ſake and hers, or on my behalf and hers; yet to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:166430:20"/> ſure, Chriſt ſpake this, as Spouſe to the Church, his welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Dovelike Spouſe; and ſo he ſpake it as head, at leaſt as political head of the Church, and ſo alſo as Mediatour; and therefore what herein he injoyneth, is to be the more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: undeniably holding forth:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this is a charge of Chriſt as Mediatour, unto all ſuch, who by place and office under him, are to reſtrain and puniſh, not by the uſe of a ſpiritual rod, or ſword ſo much, as are Church Officers; but ſpecially by the uſe of the temporal ſword, as our Civil Rulers, who in their political way, are here injoyned forcibly to take ſuch corrupters, and diſturbers of Religion, as well as of good manners.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſuch taking of ſuch Foxes, is in the nature thereof, a ſpecial ſervice to Chriſt Jeſus, as Mediatour, and Political Head of his Church. Yea and to the bleſſed Father and Spirit, in whoſe name, and to the Church it ſelf alſo, on whoſe behalf, he may ſeem to ſpeak; not thus, Take ye for me: but thus, Take ye for us, the Foxes, yea the leaſt of them, which may ſeem not to do ſo much hurt as others: the taking of all ſorts of ſuch Foxes then: who by their tenents or practiſes do hurt, and ſpoyl in the Churches, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, curbing, and puniſhing of them in ſome external forcible way; this muſt needs be very acceptable ſervice to the Lord. So Numb. 25. 11. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8. verſes compared: that extraordinary act of zeal in Phinehas, corporally puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not merely an act of corporal fornication, which then was not of it ſelf death, (though Adultery was) but a joynt act of ſpiritual whoredome too, in that Idolatry there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; (which then was puniſhable with death by the civil Magiſtrate in an ordinary way, Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. &amp; 17.) I ſay this that he did, is by God reckoned, under this head, as for him, or for his ſake, verſ. 11. <hi>while he was zealous for my ſake;</hi> and verſ. 13. <hi>becauſe he was zealous for his God.</hi> God then looked at himſelf, as in a very ſpecial manner, both concerned, and reſpected, in that ſervice of Zeal.</p>
               <p>All which places thus cleared, may help to expound that, Pſal. 2. 10, 11, 12. where the Kings and Judges of the earth are required to ſerve the Lord, the Son, Gods Anointed, verſ. 6. Now this ſervice being not injoyned them as men barely, but as Kings, even Kings upon the Throne, Job 36. 7, 11. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:166430:20"/> It cannot be reſtrained to ſervice in common with other godly perſons, but looketh alſo to Authoritative ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as Civil Rulers. Whence this Argument may be formed, in reference to that before ſpoken.</p>
               <p>All Authoritative ſervice whatſoever, of civil Rulers, unto Chriſt, is by command required of them: For <hi>ſerve the Lord,</hi> (that is, Chriſt,) is indefinite, and ſo extendible to all ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice alſo: but, (as hath been before proved) forcible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and puniſhment of corruptions in Religion, by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſword, is one ſpecial part of ſuch ſervice; therefore forcible reſtraint and puniſhment of corruptions in Religion, by the uſe of the temporal ſword, is by command of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Civil Rulers: And it muſt here further be noted, to what times this Pſalm muſt be referred: the comminatory and threatening part of the Pſalm, verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Peter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth to the times of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 25, 26, 27, as is that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 9. by John, Revel. 2. 27. &amp; 12. 5. and 19. 15. The Inſtructive part of this Pſalm, as that, verſ. 7. is by Paul applyed to Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33. that, verſe 8. concerning the Heathen, or Gentiles becoming Chriſts poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the utmoſt coaſts of the earth his Inheritance, all will yeeld muſt reſpect the times after the partition Wall, twixt Jewes and Gentiles, was broken down; and the Gentiles made the Lords habitation, Epheſ. 2. this was the time to which that <hi>[Now]</hi> verſe 10, 11. looketh. <hi>Be wiſe [now] ye Kings: ſerve the Lord with fear. Kiſſe the Son,</hi> &amp;c. verſe 12. namely thus riſen, and reigning; as verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9. do expreſſe. So then, it was not a Moſaical Injunction, reſpecting the Kings of Iſrael and Judah, who might be types of Chriſt; but it is a command lying upon Gentile Rulers, in the dayes of the New Teſtament, to ſerve Chriſt with their Authority, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining and puniſhing corruptions in Religion. And the Argument hence is undeniable.</p>
               <p>That Command of God, which is expreſſed with peculiar reference to Gentile Rulers, which ſhould rule after Chriſts Incarnation, that command muſt needs be of force in the dayes of the New Teſtament: But this command unto Princes and Judges, in their Authoritative way alſo to ſerve Chriſt, is of that nature, or is referred to the dayes of the New Teſtament;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:166430:21"/> therefore that Command is of force, or bindeth in theſe dayes of the New Teſtament: The Propoſition is evident, becauſe the Commands of God muſt needs bind the perſons reſpected and intended in thoſe very commands. The Aſſumption was before cleared: So that the Concluſion remaineth undeniable; and there wanteth not now a binding command of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſuch Authoritative ſervice of Chriſt, by Civil Rulers, as that is, and was proved to be; namely Authoritatively to reſtrain and puniſh ſuch corruptions in Religion.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon of the Aſſertion is taken from the end, to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> which the Civil Magiſtrate is appointed of God: whether that end be more General or Special.</p>
               <p>In the General, he is appointed for the good of ſuch as are under his ſubjection: he is the Miniſter of God to thee for thy good; Indefinitely, Rom. 13. 4. whether that good be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; as life and ſafety of their bodies: or moral; as tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, chaſtity, honeſty, and the like: or civil, as civil peace, civil liberties, mens Lands, goods, eſtates, &amp;c. or Spiritual; as the free paſſage of the Word and Ordinances of God, the purity of all the worſhip of God, and of the Doctrine and Diſcipline of Chriſt diſpenced, and the like. Now if God make the Civil Magiſtrate, the Miniſter of all this good to the ſubjects, then hath he armed them with civil power, in a civil way, and by political meanes to promote that good of the Subjects; and to reſcue from whatſoever externally breaketh forth, tending to impair that Good of the ſubjects; and who ſeeth not, that Corruptions in matters of Religion, do ſome way or other ſtrike at all that good? not alone, by provoking God in Judgment either to blaſt all that good unto a people, amongſt whom ſuch corruptions prevail; but the corruptions themſelves occaſion breaches upon mens natural, and civil good; even their lives, ſafety, eſtates, civil peace and liberty, and the like. Witneſſe the ſad fruits of Popery, too oft in England; of Anabaptiſme in Germany, in John of Leyden and Cnipper Dollings dayes; of Levelliſme not long ſince in England, when the better part of the Army were ſent down towards Oxford (as I remember) to ſuppreſſe the ſtirre rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Levellers, and I wiſh that might have been the laſt of the deſtructive, turbulent, ſeditious, or trecherous deſignes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:166430:21"/> of men groſly corrupted in their Judgments, in the matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>As for the moral good of ſubjects under Civil Authority, how much ſuch corruptions do intrench thereupon, let the woful experience of the looſeneſſe, and even profaneneſſe of too many in both <hi>Englands,</hi> amongſt whom corruptions in matters of Religion, have taken place, teſtifie; beſides the ſcandal upon Religion, which ſuch have brought in the eyes of the common ſort, which have made little or no profeſſion, and the woful miſcarriages thereby occaſioned amongſt them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But how ſuch corrupt perſons are branded in Scripture, for ſuch miſchiefs and miſcarriages, let theſe places be duly conſidered, Rom. 16. 18. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. compared with verſe 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19. Jude 4. with verſe 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19. 2 Tim. 4. 3, 4. 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. whence alſo ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous times, 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13. whence railings, ſtrifes, and the like, 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4. whence increaſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, 2 Tim. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>And is not then the Civil Magiſtrate, whoſe end, partly, is the ſubjects natural, and civil good, bound, in his political way, to reſtrain and redreſſe the cauſes of the contrary evil? but ſpecially as the Magiſtrate is a political Miniſter of God, in his civil way, and by his Civil means, of the ſubjects ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good; ſo he is to improve his Authority, that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, purity, and peace of Gods own inſtituted worſhip, and wayes, wherein their ſpiritual good, externally, doth much lye, be maintained and defended againſt all Infeſting, infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, Impugning or Impairing principles, or practiſes break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to the contrary; the Civil Magiſtrate, in Gods Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, is a Miniſter to the Churches good, as that of Rome, to which Paul writ, Chap. 1. 7. &amp; 13. 4. compared, he is the Miniſter of God to thee, for thy good. Eſay 60. 11. the Gentile Kings ſhall be brought to the Church, to be added to it: they ſhall alſo as Kings (in ſome reſpect) ſerve the Church: elſe as verſe 12. <hi>the Nation, and the Kingdome</hi> (or Authoritative part of the Nation) <hi>that will not ſerve thee,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Church) <hi>ſhall periſh:</hi> and verſe 10. <hi>Their Kings ſhall miniſter to thee:</hi> Yea in point of the very Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church: which is to it as its walls, they ſhall help in the building thereof; by their Civil Authority, ſetting up
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:166430:22"/> that in their Juriſdictions, ſtrengthening, ſetling, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the ſame there. Hence verſ. 10. <hi>And the ſonnes of ſtrangers ſhall build thy walls, their Kings ſhall miniſter to thee;</hi> namely in that matter of building her walls alſo there mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: hence alſo they are called <hi>the builders of the Churches walls,</hi> Eſay 49 16, 17. compared. <hi>Thy walls are before me: Thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> or (as in the Hebrew) <hi>thy builders</hi> (namely of thoſe walls) <hi>make haſte.</hi> As builders, by their Civil Authority, they ſhall break down all manifeſt unevenneſſe in the Churches fabrick, curb all palpable Intruſions of any bad ſtuffe therein, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe whatſoever might viſibly undermine the ſame: and all this ſpoken with reference to the Dayes of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Gentiles ſhould be thus behoveful to the Church, verſe 22. <hi>I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles.</hi> Verſe 23. <hi>and Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers,—they ſhall bow to thee with their faces toward the earth.</hi> So Eſay 60. 3. <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightneſſe of thy riſing.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>Surely the Iſles ſhall wait for me:</hi> verſe 10. <hi>The ſons of ſtrangers ſhall build up thy walls, and their Kings ſhall minister to thee.</hi> So Rev. 22. 24. <hi>And the Kings of the earth ſhall bring their glory to it:</hi> namely, to that new Jeruſalem or pureſt Goſpel Church: not in heaven; but which cometh from God, out of heaven, verſ. 2.</p>
               <p>Now the glory of the Kings of the earth, is chiefly their Soveraignty and Civil Authority; which Chriſt by John ſaith, they ſhall bring to the Church: not to be reſigned to them, or uſurped by the Church, or any of her Officers: they ſhall be Kings ſtill, although miniſtring, as Kings, to the Church, Eſay 60. 10. but they ſhall bring this their glory to the Church, to be improved for the Churches good; or for the maintaining the doctrine, diſcipline, and waies of God held forth by the Church in the purity, and liberty thereof: againſt all oppoſers, impugners, deſpiſers, depravers, diſturbers, and corrupters thereof.</p>

               <p>A third Reaſon of this Aſſertion may be taken, both from <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> the Prayers which the Lord chargeth his people to make for this end; and from the praiſes alſo which they return to God when ſuch an end is Attained.</p>
               <p>The former is held forth, 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. <hi>I exhort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet, and a peaceable life, in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſty.</hi> Whence it will neceſſarily follow:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it never cometh of God, for any to deſire to lead a quiet and peaceable life, or to be let alone without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation from Civil Authority, in any way contrary, either to godlineſſe, or honeſty; the contrary deſire, being that onely which God here putteth his upon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that civil Rulers by their Office and place, now in the dayes of the New Teſtament, are to looke to matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Godlineſſe: whether Doctrinal, or practical, ſo far as acted by the outward man, and appearing in outward view in their life or the like, as well as they are in the like way, to looke to the matters of honeſtie. As he that is taught to pray
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:166430:23"/> that he may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſſe, and Honeſtie, prayeth that he may lead a life in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and honeſtie, (without which to pray for peace and quiet in any other life, or to pray to be let alone unmoleſted, in any ungodly or diſhoneſt way of his life, even but to aske leave and libertie to ſinne.) So he that prayeth to the Lord, for all that are in higheſt civil Authoritie, as for Kings or the like; for this end, that he may live in all Godlyneſſe and Honeſtie, quietly, and peaceably, he prayeth to God, to cauſe the perſons in ſuch civil authoritie, to further by their civil authoritie ſuch an end, to which under God they are an externall means, and ſurely then he prayeth, that perſons in civil Authoritie may in ſuch ſort attend and look to matters as well of pietie, as of honeſty, appearing in any acts or wayes of their ſubjects lives; as that their ſubjects may in ſuch godly and honeſt acts and wayes of their life and in no other injoy peace and quiet.</p>
               <p>If this kinde of prayer here exhorted unto, be in the matter according to Gods Will (as it muſt needs be, being what the Holy Ghoſt by part exhorteth unto;) It is then according to Gods own Will, that civil Magiſtrates ſhould Authoritatively ſee to it, that their ſubjects lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlyneſſe and honeſtie; which quiet and peaceable life is not alone a life free from diſturbance, by perſecution, for any act or way of Godlyneſſe or honeſtie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing outwardly, but a life free from diſturbance in any ſuch acts or wayes of Godlineſſe or honeſtie by any other open, and manifeſt diſturbers thereof, whether ſuch as by open violence combine together to hinder the Godly from meeting together publikely or privately to worſhip the Lord according to his mind, or ſuch as prophanely riſe up in their Aſſemblies or Families, and openly diſturb them in that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or interrupting them by unſeemly and unconvenient ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures; talking, ſhowting, ſinging or the like; or ſuch as openly revile them, rail upon them, or at leaſt raſhly cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, and openly proteſt againſt them, and the worſhip and wayes of God held forth and practiſed by them, and by the reſt of the Aſſemblies and Families of the Saints amongſt them, or take any other wayes, undermining and ſtriking at their quiet and peaceable living in all godlineſs or honeſtie. The
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:166430:23"/> Greek words in this text, 1 Tim. 2. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> are obſervable, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is that quiet of a Serene ſea, when free from turbulent winds, and by proportion it is a quiet life in all godlineſs and honeſtie; when not alone guſts of perſecution diſturb it not: but when winds of falſe doctrines too, (as Eph. 4. 14. <hi>They are called,</hi> are not ſuffered to moleſt and unſettle the ſame. This then is the ſum that the truly godly do even beg of God on the behalf of Magiſtrates: that they may diſcharge their dutie in their authoritative care and indeavour, that their Subjects may firſt lead godly and honeſt lives: ſecondly, Lead their godly and honeſt life in ſuch ſort as to be free from what ever may undermine, unſettle or diſturb their quiet and peace therein. Touching the latter, namely the Saints praiſes when ſuch an end is attained: we ſe it is in Ezras time, they thankfully acknowledge it, as put into their Rulers hearts, not from Satan, the world or the ſleſh, but from the Lord himſelf, to take ſuch effectual and exact care of pure, peaceable and comfortable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the whole work of God committed to them; Ezra 7. 25, 26, 27, 28. verſes compared Revel. 11. 15. It is acknowledged to the Lords praiſe, that <hi>the kingdoms of the earth are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that as v. 17.) <hi>He taketh to him his Kingdome.</hi> Now the kingdoms of the earth become Chriſts Kingdoms, not alone when either the people thereof become godly, or when their Rulers with them ſubject themſelves as godly to Chriſts government in his Churches: but when the Rulers, who rule under Chriſt, and by Chriſt, doe rule likewiſe for Chriſt; and by their civil power ſeek to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch as openly oppoſe, or croſs, or attempt to ſubvert, or pervert his royal lawes and bleſſed rules and inſtitutions, held forth in his holy word. Surely where ſubſtitute Rulers doe rule for another, they muſt needs be ſuch as do authoritatively vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate all injuries done to the lawes of their Soveraign. So is it in the caſe of civil Rulers, ruling under and for Chriſt. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a mercy to the Saints and Churches of Chriſt, when king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in their ruling part give free libertie to hold forth and exerciſe the wayes of Chriſt: but yet this is not enough to make it out all here ſpoken: yet their Chriſt taketh to him his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or that ſuch kingdoms be become thereby the Kingdoms of Jeſus Chriſt; for beſide that ſuch a toleration in caſe, may put no more honour upon Chriſt then upon Antichriſt: (For
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:166430:24"/> they may happily tolerate and often do tolerate in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, properly as well as the pure worſhip and wayes of Jeſus Chriſt;) ſuch a toleration of the purer wayes and doctrines of Chriſt, may be yielded unto and allowed by the authoritie of kingdoms, which profeſſedly avow the Pope to be head of the Church, and prefer the Decrees, Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Church (as they call it) above the Lawes of Chriſt; and by their ſecular power maintain the power and kingdome of the beaſt openly: as doth the kingdome of France at this day; and yet none will ſay that Chriſt hath taken to him his Kingdome in France; or that France is become already the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt in any other way, then in that general way, in which all power in earth as wel as heaven is his which is not that, at which that text Rev. 11. 15. looketh.

               <p>A fourth Reaſon of that aſſertion, is taken from the zeale, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> foretold to be in inferior Chriſtians in the pureſt times of the Goſpel; whereby they ſhould provoke civil authoritie to ſuch a work, as the uſe of the civil ſword to curb and puniſh perſons notoriouſly guiltie of corruptions in Religion. Zacharie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth of times, when thoſe both of the ten and of the two tribes ſhal be brought on to Chriſt, and their Rulers with them; whence ſuch holy mourning of that Tribe of Shimei, and of the other families, yea and of all the land, together with that of the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, Zech. 12. 10, 12, 13, 14. compared; and as that in the people ſo in their Rulers; thoſe of the houſe of David mourn over Chriſt crucified alſo; verſe 10. and are ſuch as the Godly can ſafely confide in; verſ. 5. 6. Now in that very day and time when it ſhould be thus with them; as the Lord will purge them by the bloud of Chriſt from their ſin; Zech. 13 1. ſo in the ſame dutie ſhal they be all zealous to purge the land from all corruptions in Religion which may provoke the eyes of Gods glory, Zech. 13. 2, 1. and if notwithſtanding exemplary

Any under pretence of the name or of ground from the word and counſel of God, ſhall hold forth falſe Doctrine then (as verſe 3.) <hi>If any ſhall yet propheſie (or ſpeak lies in the Name of the Lord) his father and his mother that begot him, ſhall ſay unto him, thou ſhalt not live, for thou ſpeakeſt lies in the Name of the Lord:</hi> and to ſhew that it is no raſh threatning of capital puniſhment for ſuch falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; they will be active alſo to bring them to condigne puniſhment; for ſo it followeth: His father and his mother that begot him, ſhal thruſt him through when he propheſieth. Nor can theſe puniſhments of corruptions in Religion, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons notoriouſly guiltie thereof, be meant of puniſhments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Divine, by ſome immediate ſtroak of God or Chriſt; for the father and the mother in ſome caſes thruſt them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough; verſe 3. In other caſes they are branded and wounded in the hands, by their friends, verſe 6.

Nor yet are theſe corporal puniſhments of ſuch perſons meerly aeconomical and parental corrections of their children in a private way; unleſs any will ſay, that even in times wherein godly civil Rulers (who put forth their civil power of the ſword againſt open enemies, Zech. 12. 5, 6.) are to be had and made uſe of, godly parents may execute death upon their children, for holding corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; without making uſe of civil authoritie, for that end. It remaineth therefore, that the puniſhments here mentioned, are ſuch as are of a civil and political nature, by the uſe of the authoritie of the civil Magiſtrate; whereas even godly parents and friends ſhal be active; and ſhal in a ſenſe puniſh them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner of witneſſes againſt them, having been conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, convicted and cenſured, by lawful civil authority, alluding to that Deut. 13, 6. where <hi>when a man or womans, ſon or daughter, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be themſelves corrupt in Religion, and ſeek to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt others, they were not to conceal or ſpare him, but they were to kill him. verſe 9. which is expounded by that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him, to put him to death, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the hands of all the people:</hi> which is further expounded

Its ſaid, <hi>The hands of the witneſſes ſhall be firſt upon him, to put him to death;</hi> and afterwards, <hi>The hands of all the people.</hi> So that a private man or woman in ſuch caſes, did regularly ſtone and kil another; as giving in caſting evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for his fault, and then as witneſſes by order of that politie, did caſt the firſt ſtone at him, and ſo killed him: and as much, and no more is here held forth as orderly in the dayes of the Goſpel. This uſe therefore of the coercive and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power of civil authoritie, in matters of the firſt Table, is the more obſervable, as that which wil be called for by the Saints in the beſt times, and likewiſe exerciſed by godly civil Rulers, even when the Jewes ſhal come home to Jeſus Chriſt; and obſervable it is who it is that ingageth that theſe things ſhal be ſo done; even the ſame Jehovah mentioned Zech. 12. 1.

Hence corrupt doctrines, called doctrines of Devils, 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Now Chriſt here ingageth to curſe his peoples land to be rid of theſe falſe Teachers; ſo that ſo far as political Governours in the civil ſence of the converted Jewes, ſhal rid their land of ſuch falſe Teachers, whether they doe it by baniſhment, or death, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral demerits, the Lord Jeſus owneth their juridical vindicative acts, as his acts he cauſeth this; That Government is Chriſts

When Idolaters are commanded to be ſtoned, Deut. 17. 2, 3, 5, 7. its added, <hi>ſo ſhalt thou put the evil away from among you:</hi> and as evil is removed hereby, ſo is good attained; both moral, Deut. 17. 10. All Iſrael ſhall hear and fear, and do no more any ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and civil good, as that in outward eſtate; as when theirs was impoveriſhed by that drought and famine, yet upon the execution of Juſtice upon thoſe Idolaters, reparation is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in made by that ruine, 1 King. 18. 40, 41. alſo that of Civil peace, 2 Chron. 14. 3, 4, 5.

Yea if it be in it ſelf Lording over conſcience, to puniſh groſſe corruptions in Religion, for which men pretend conſcience: then if Churches in a Church way puniſh hereticks, cut them off from Church communion, or deliver them up to Satan, they lord it over mens faith and conſciences; they would force others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as they do believe, when yet thoſe others profeſſe that in conſcience they cannot do ſo; and ſo will force other mens conſciences. But will any ſay, that this is forcing conſcience,

Beſides, if ſuch Church reſtrictions of the corruptions in Religion, or puniſhing of them Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, when yet they are matters of conſcience, be forcing of other men to our belief, and forcing mens conſciences: why are Churches to cenſure hereticks? firſt, by that cenſure of Admonition, once, or oftner; and after that, of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tit. 3. 10, 11. or why did not Paul himſelf let Himeneus and Alexander alone? or why is he ſo earneſt that ſuch falſe teachers who troubled the Galatian Churches, might bear their (Eccleſiaſtical) Judgment and be (Eccleſiaſtically cut off, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 10, 12.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

The perſons more ſpecially ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to upon that ground to doe well, becauſe then they have praiſe of the ſame; or in caſe they do evil, then they are to fear the vengeance of the Lord to be executed by his Miniſter, the Magiſtrate; they are Profeſſours, Officers and Members of Churches, ſuch as they were at Rome, Rom. 1. 7. and 12. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. compared with chap. 13. 3, 4. If thou do that which is evil, fear, &amp;c. which all will confeſs to be liable to evil doing againſt the firſt as well as the ſecond Table. 3.

Now the Scripture reckons eſpecially the doing of perſons of corrupt judgements; as perſons ſo corrupt to be evil deeds.

               <p> A ſecond Inſtruction from the premiſes, is, that ſurely then perſons in Civil Authority are in duty bound, even as they are perſons in civil Authority under God and Chriſt, as they are Miniſters of God, to indeavour the exact knowledge of his Law, Word and Rules; as other under-Rulers, are to know the Lawes of their Soveraign: for if they muſt reſtrain and puniſh, what is croſſe to thoſe Rules, they ought to know the Rules; elſe how ſhould they know what is croſſe to the Rules of the Word? or before they puniſh the ſame, how will they be able to uſe ſuch means of conviction of offendors againſt thoſe Rules, as God requireth? God put this principle into the heart even of Artaxerxes; that ſuch as knew the Lawes of God, ſhould be ſet in Authority to puniſh ſuch as did contrary to the Law of God, Ezra 7. 25, 26, 27, 28. compared. God by Jethro counſelled, that Rulers ſhould be men of Ability; even in Scripture, as well as other Lawes and learning, Exod. 18. 21. and Deut. 1. 13. compared; the book of the Law was ever to be with the Rulers ſet over Gods people, Deut. 17. 18. Joſh. 1. 7, 8. Eſay 32. 1, 2. &amp; 33. 6. wiſdom and knowledge in ſuch as rule, is the ſtability of their times. It is Gods Ordinance to Gentile Rulers, that they ſhould be wiſe and inſtructed; even in the things, wayes and words of God, Pſal. 2. 10, 11. Pagan Rulers indeed, whileſt Pagan, do not know the Word, and ſo cannot ſo well puniſh what is croſſe to it; but of right and duty they are bound to know both.</p>
               <p>A third Inſtruction hence, is; that if ſuch corruptions in Religion, are to be ſo reſtrained and puniſhed by higheſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Authority, then are higheſt Civil Authority, which chiefly require ſuch puniſhment to be executed, to make Coercive Lawes about matters of Religion. For if ſo to puniſh, then in an ordinary way to do it, either by vertue of ſome political Law eſtabliſhed and promulged for that end: and then the caſe is granted; or elſe without ſuch a Law: and then way is made to bring in Arbitrary and tyrannical Government. Yea when a Civil State doth agree, in ſuch or ſuch matters of God, to be guided by the Word of God, and neceſſary deductions thence, what puniſhments to inflict upon ſuch or ſuch corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Religion: Now that which is materially conſidered, the Law and Word of God, yet formally conſidered, as thus
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:166430:33"/> politically ratified and promulged; It is ſo far forth of the nature of a political law, and doth but ſtrengthen this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; That what a Civil State muſt puniſh, they muſt make political Lawes for that end; in that extraordinary caſe, Moſes without a law muſt puniſh that blaſphemer, Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus 24. 11, 12, 13, 14. but in reference to ordinary exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Juſtice that way for the future; God biddeth Moſes to promulge a ſolemn Law in Iſrael, that <hi>whoſoever blasphemeth the name of the Lord, ſhall ſurely be put to death,</hi> verſ. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Touching this particular, 1. we diſtinguiſh of Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Civil Magiſtrates are conſidered either Indefinitely, or in a limited ſenſe. Indefinitely conſidered, they are the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God; the Civil Powers that be are ordained of God; <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. yea they are of Chriſt, under whom they rule, and by whom they decree whatſoever. Juſtice they do decree, Prov. 8. 15, 16. <hi>by me;</hi> who that is, is explained, verſ. 30. <hi>then I was by him, and I was daily his delight:</hi> and verſ. 31. <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth,</hi> &amp;c. by this eſſential wiſdom of God, <hi>Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> whether juſt Lawes againſt evil doers, or juſt cenſures, according to thoſe Lawes: he <hi>is King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15, 16, 17. Rev. 17. 14. &amp; 19. 16. if conſidered in a limited ſenſe, under this or that form of Rule or Magiſtracy, whether Monarchical, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical, Democratical, or mixt of Ariſtocracy and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy: ſo it is a humane creature, as the Greek termeth it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Civil Magiſtrates are conſidered either as rightly ordered according to God; or as ſome way defective to his order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Regulated Magiſtrates, ordered according to the Rules of God and Chriſt, whoſe Ordinance they are, and by whom they rule; they are well verſed in Scripture, Deut. 17. 18, 19, 20. men of choyce Abilities for wiſdom and underſtanding; yea even in the things of God, Exod. 18. 21. &amp; Deut. 1. 13, compared: <hi>ſuch as fear God, ibid.</hi> ſuch as rule in Gods fear, 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. ſuch as do ſpiritual homage to Jeſus Chriſt, Pſal. 72. 10, 11. are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſe, and well inſtructed, Pſal. 2. 10. <hi>Kiſſe the Son,</hi> with the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:166430:34"/> kiſſe of faith, love and obedience, verſe 12. ſerve him, verſ. 11. not as men only, but as Kings and Judges Are nurſing Fathers to the Church, Eſay 49. 23. are brought to the Church to joyn with it, Eſay 60. 11. ſtoop to the Government of the Church as members of it, Eſay 49. 23. bring the glory of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Church, Rev. 21. 24. thereby to miniſter every way, in way of protection, preſervation, and eſtabliſhment thereof, Civilly, in peace, and purity of doctrine and diſcipline, and the like, Eſay 60. 10. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. every way in their political manner, Miniſters even to Gentile Churches, ſuch as that of Rome was, for its good, Rom. 13. 4. and <hi>a terrour not to good works but to evil,</hi> Rom. 13. 3. In this reſpect, its ſo far from truth, that a godly man and member of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould not be a Magiſtrate; (when yet godly Moſes, Joſhuah, David, Aſah, Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah, Joſiah, Zerubbabel, Nehemiah, and others of old were: and ſo in and after Chriſts Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was Joſeph of Arimathea, Joh 19. 38. ſo was he, Joh. 4. 46, 53. compared: ſo was Cornelius, Act. 10. 2. and Sergius Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Acts 13. 7. 12. compared, that Eunuch, Acts 8. 27. 37. compared, Eraſtus, Rom. 16. 23. &amp;c.) that according to Gods rule, ſuch an one ſhould be the only man for that office. The Concluſion in ſpecial wiſe reſpected regulated Magiſtrates, and not ſo much ſuch as are defective to their ſupream Lords order and rules, and ſundry wayes groſly tranſgreſſing the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Civil Magiſtrates are conſidered in the perfection ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Eſſence of their Magiſtracie, or of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraticall Operations.</p>
               <p>In the former ſence Pagans and other Rulers not regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to Gods Rules, and perfect Rulers, and have a perfect right to eſtabliſh true Religion, and to make good our Lawes to that end; Albeit for want of light, they know it not, or for want of a better heart they doe it not: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as out of the like defects, they eſtabliſh not many wholſome Rules, and Lawes of civil Honeſtie and Iuſtice; albeit as Rulers, they have a power to doe it. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, if regulated, they are compleate, if not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, then in ſo farre forth, ſundry wayes imperfect, and deficient.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:166430:34"/>
               <p> Secondly, we diſtinguiſh of Kingdoms or Common-wealths in which they rule. They are either greater or leſſer, the Rule concerneth both alike.</p>
               <p>Again, they are either Pagan, not intended in the point; or Chriſtan, and theſe again either more pure, and better ſquared according to Gods rules, whoſe they are; or they are more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and Apoſtatizing from truth, or from purity and power in Religion; that point reacheth both.</p>
               <p>Again theſe corrupter States are conſidered as ſo corrupt, either in the body of the Spirituall guides thereof, or in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People, or in both: Neither the one nor the other are in Religion; excluded the point.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we diſtinguiſh of Legiſlative power in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It is either Abſolute, and meerly Soveraign; and ſo onely God, and Chriſt is Law-giver unto his people, both for matters of Religion and Righteouſneſs, Piety and Honeſty, Firſt and ſecond table. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>There is one Law-giver.</hi> Eſay 33. 22. <hi>The Lord is our Law-giver.</hi> Or it is ſubordinate and ſubſervient, and in a way of conformity and reſpect to the Laws of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made by God, and ſo as men may be Kings and Judges, though in other reſpects the Lord alone be King and Judge. <hi>Eſay</hi> 33. 22. ſo may men alſo make juſt decrees, &amp; be Law-givers. Again, Law-givers are conſidered, either as Infallibly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired: ſuch a one was <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 21. 18. or as bound indeed to the Rules of God, which are of Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but not alwaies Infallibly caried out, according to thoſe Rules, and ſo others in higheſt place are Law-givers, as where thoſe Jewiſh Rulers long after <hi>Moſes</hi> time, with whom the civill Scepter was, they were Law-givers, and long after <hi>Davids</hi> time and <hi>Solomons</hi> (who had their inſpirations) ſo far as the Scepter, or Higher Civill power departed not from them, a Law-giver was among them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16. Theſe Humane juſt decrees of higheſt Civill Rulers are by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, there is a power ſimply Eccleſiaſticall, reſpecting the decent, and orderly carrying on of the worſhip of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to generall Rules of the Scripture, and the preſcripts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prudence, left to the Churches liberty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. (though theſe conſtitutions are not ſo properly Laws but rather are Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall directions of order, and decorum, about externall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:166430:35"/> Rites, and circumſtances of worſhip,) which we grant, there is a Nomothetique power about matters of Religion, which is meerly Politicall and Civill, to which the concluſion looketh. There is a power ſuppoſed which is mixed, that is, partly Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and partly Civill, which ſome give to the Pope, as do ſome Papiſts, ſome in name Proſteſtants, do give to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes; but this confuſion of the two powers and ſwords, we deny to be from the God of Order.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we diſtinguiſh of Laws about Religion.</p>
               <p>They are conſidered either materially or Formally.</p>
               <p>Concerning ſuch Lawes materially conſidered, they are either of ſuch things which are manifeſtly croſs to divine Laws, which are the onely Authentique and preſidentiall Laws, condemned in <hi>Jereboam</hi> and other wicked Princes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 28. to the end; of ſuch Laws ſee allſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11. Or they are Humane Sanctions of the Laws of God, and of that which is according to thoſe Laws which we aſſert.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Things according to the Word, properly reſpect either Fundamentalls, or Circa-fundamentalls; matters bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon Fundamentalls, and circumſtantially in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or matters reſpecting Religion, of greater or leſſer weight; we would not exclude either from being materialls of Humane Civill Sanctions. 3. Matters of Religion are either ſuch as are manifeſtly in the Word, or ſuch, which though in thmeſelves, in the word, and grounds of it, yet not ſo clearly, but very diſputably; the regulated Magiſtrates or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Power, extendeth to deal about both, onely in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner. 4 Diſputable matters in Religion are, either ſuch which are ſo really and in themſelves, or ſo onely Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily and meerly from Humane defects and corruptions, as when not ſo to the moſt and beſt Judgements of the ableſt Saints and ſervants of God, but to ſome few, and that either through weakneſs of Judgement, or through ſophiſticall argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of men of corrupt minds, or through groſs neglects and contempts of means of Inſtruction; theſe allſo admit of ſeverall Conſiderations in Politicall times about matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning ſuch Laws about Religion formally conſidered, we diſtinguiſh. They are either ſuch which are made of equall Authority with the Word, and ſuch which of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:166430:35"/> and in themſelves doe bind Conſcience, which Popiſh Tenent we abhor; or they are ſuch which are no other but humane Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Sanctions, and Ratifications, and Promulgations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, commanding, or forbidding what the Law or Word of God, either expreſly, or by juſt conſequence commandeth, or forbiddeth, ſo far as openly acted by the outward man, with ſuitable humane rewards or puniſhments annexed, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience onely ſo far as the Word it ſelf allowing the Authority, and the Laws likewiſe made by the Authority bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame. This we aſſert.</p>
               <p>Again, Humane Laws this way, are either ſuch as being made by Civill Authority, yet are ſuppoſed to come from ſome Church power reſiding in the ſayd Authority, and ſo to be by virtue of that Civill Authority Properly and Formally Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Laws, which we deny: Or ſuch which are materially, and Objectively Eccleſiaſticall Laws, that is, politicall, humane Sanctions of Gods Rules and Laws reſpecting the Church alſo, and Church Ordinances, which we aſſert. And now having layd down theſe diſtinctions, let us come to ſome Concluſions about this weighty matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. Higheſt Civil Authority may not impoſe what form of Worſhip, or of Church Diſcipline, they pleaſe, as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and ſome others ſince him affirm: For both the Matter of the Worſhip of God, and the Means of Worſhip, whether Church Diſcipline, or any other Means, are limited by our own Law-giver to ſuch and ſuch Rules and Laws made to hand, and not left to any humane power to make it way. Neither may any humane powers, which are his Miniſters, tranſgreſs the Laws of this their Supreme, either by adding thereto any Law of their own, or taking there-from; they may, and muſt in their way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d place, look to the due execution of his Laws, but foiſt in no new Law of their own, in things of his Worſhip. Hence that Injunction given to <hi>Joſhuah</hi> as Judge and Ruler, <hi>Joſhuah</hi> 1. 7, 8. <hi>Obſerve to doe according to all the Law which</hi> Moſes <hi>my ſervant commanded thee:</hi> He is therefore to look to the keeping of both Tables, commanded of God by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but muſt not turn from it to the right hand, or to the left. So gentle Princes muſt firſt be inſtructed (even in the Laws and mind of Chriſt) and then ſerve him as their Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 10, 11. God rooted out <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:166430:36"/> for this, and Iſrael for following ſuch like Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11. and brandeth ſuch Ordinances in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are not according to his Word, but mans device and will, to be <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> Col. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. Civill Authority may not impoſe, either what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials, or ſignificant Ceremonies in Religion they pleaſe, ſuch ſignificant Waſhings injoyned are forbidden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 2. 7. 9. God left not them of old, either in matter of a very Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or the like, in the Tabernacle; or in the matter of any ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremony to their own wits; but if he thought meet of teaching them any ſuch way, he himſelf told them thereof, and required it of them, as in thoſe ſignificant Ceremonies at the Paſſeover at firſt, of eating it with their loyns girt, with ſtaves in their hand, and ſhooes on their feet, to note their haſty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 11. And in that of the Plates for a covering of the Altar, made of thoſe rebellious ones; Cenſers, to ſignifie, that none not of <hi>Aarons</hi> houſe, might ever after that dare to offer Incenſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 38, 40. And of like ſignificancy was <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that budded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. Higheſt Civill Authority hath no power formally Eccleſiaſticall to make Church Laws, ſo called, under pain of Excommunication, to be by virtue of their Authority executed by Eccleſiaſticall perſons, as thoſe who ſhould in their names ſummon, examine, and cenſure ſuch as will not actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to ſuch orders. This confuſion of Civill, and Church-power, and tyrannicall abuſe of Civill Authority, will bring confuſions upon States, which againſt all admonitions of Gods faithfull ſervants perſiſt therein, as it did to <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his houſe, and all the reſt of Iſraels Princes which went in his footſteps, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 14, 15. &amp; 13. 4. 9. 12. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 4. No Civill Authority can by their Laws free any of their ſubjects, either from Eccleſiaſtical duties to the Church, as Members thereof; or from Church cenſures; nay, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any ſuch Law exempt themſelves, if Church members, from any ſuch Church duty or cenſure, much leſs can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt others; thoſe juſt duties and cenſures being authorized by the Soveraign Authority of Chriſt, as King, and Law-giver of his Church, and laying that bond upon Conſcience, which no humane, no nor Angelicall power can unlooſe, though they ſhould aſſay it. Chriſt requiring <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to preach him
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:166430:36"/> to the people, the Jewiſh Rulers forbid them, it is not right in Gods ſight, themſelves being Judges, that man ſhould be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather than God, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20. This Chriſt condemned of old in them, that by their Injunctions would invalidate the Commandements of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 5. Higheſt Civill Authority cannot make any Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, which do formally, and as they are humane Laws, bind their ſubjects Conſciences.</p>
               <p>For firſt, neither men, nor any Laws of men, can looſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from any guilt upon it, and therefore neither can they by any power of theirs bind it under guilt; For <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe men cannot take cognizance of the obedience, or diſobedience of Conſcience it ſelf, within it ſelf, to their Laws; nor can any humane teſtimony from without be produced, how Conſcience doth carry it in its internall acts; God and Chriſt onely know, and try the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 23. No man knoweth what is in man but the ſpirit of man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe man cannot force either the mind or heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Conſcience partaketh, either to think. judge, or chuſe after their mindes or Laws, other than what themſelves chuſe; though they may force the outward man. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> doth his pleaſure with their bodies, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. yet <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. they will not ſerve his Gods.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe men cannot reward Conſcience with any reward ſuitable to it, as inward peace or comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in caſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Laws: God alone giveth ſoul-comfort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe men cannot puniſh the ſoul and ſpirit, thought it ſhould diſobey their commands, they can onely kill the body, but not hurt the ſoul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe if mens Laws of themſelves bound Conſcience,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:166430:37"/> then at the day of Judgement men ſhould not be judged onely according to the Word and Laws of God and Chriſt, as is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>John</hi> 12. 48. but according to mans Laws alſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe it is poſſible that mens Laws though ſuppoſed to be according to the Word, yet they may not really be ſo: Now if mens Laws did formally bind Conſcience, then men ſhould ſtand Conſcience bound ſometimes to tranſgreſs the rules of Gods Word, by virtue whereof alone all mans Laws do bind. True it is, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 3. Subjects are to obey Authority for conſcience ſake, but not as out of Conſcience to mans Laws, as humane, but by virtue of the fifth Commandement requiring honour of ſubjection to their Superiors lawfull Authority and commands, and by virtue of any ſuch particular Scriptures upon which any particular Laws of Churches are grounded.</p>
               <p>Now let us lay down ſome poſitive Concluſions about this Nomothetique power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. Firſt then in the general we affirm, That higheſt Civil Authority in a Religious State may make Political Laws, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch, about matters of Religion, and matters reſpecting the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 1. Becauſe ſupreme Political, or Civil power of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative keeping the firſt, as well as the ſecond Table, is the Civill Rulers both duty and privilege, But Nomothetique power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout both Tables is ſuch ſupreme power; And hence the King and Judge in Iſrael, is charged with keeping the whole Law of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 17 19. &amp; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 7, 8.

How did he and the reſt of the Civil State keep the charge of the Lord? Surely in a way oppoſite to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the Iſraelite ſtates forſaking the ſame (as the oppoſition of the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Context ſheweth) now this was by Authoritative commanding the ſetting up of corrupt Prieſts, and injoyning the corrupt Worſhip and Service, and inhibiting, depoſing, and baniſhing the fruitfull Miniſters of Gods appointing, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>

That which the Lord himſelf hath either put higher Civill powers upon, or hath owned, or commended either in ſuch as were within, or without the

               <p>Secondly, If becauſe each one as a Chriſtian, is in a private way to Iudge of his own act, the Magiſtrate Legiſlatively and Iuridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally may not determine in his Politicall way that any thing is duty or not, in matters of Religion, unleſs according to ſuch particular Chriſtians Iudgements: then it is unlikely, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that any law about Religion ſhould be made, or any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall determination thereof given: ſince ſome will be of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent minds, yea about fundamentalls; as for example, ſome will Iudge the Pope to be head of the Church: ſome that Chriſt is not very God, ſome that he is not very man: ſome will hold ſuch Incouragements to well doers ſhould be given, others will differ from them: yea the like will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in matters of the ſecond table, upon like grounds, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians therein alſo are to follow their own Iudgements and not other mens: and whatſoever in ſuch matters alſo, is not of faith, is ſin: therefore it muſt not be Politically determined, that lying with another man wife is ſin, or to be puniſhed at all by State or Church, ſince ſome Iudge a community of the uſe of the bodies of Siſters (at leaſt) to be lawfull, nor muſt the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of others goods or cattell from them for others uſe, be Politically determined or puniſhed as evill, ſince ſundry Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Iudge a community of ſuch things alſo to be good: nor muſt the taking away of Heretique-princes lives by Aſſaſſinates be Politically determined and puniſhed, as evill, ſince Chriſtians of Popiſh Iudgements, think it a meritorious act.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then could not it not be orderly determined, no not <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 13.</note> with conſent of the body of the people, that ſuch as would not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:166430:50"/> ſeek the Lord—ſhould be put to death: ſince ſundry might judge it too harſh, yea in determining thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they implied that ſome would be of another mind, &amp; ly open to that cenſure: yet its recorded to their honour, that they did ſo. Exo. 34. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Theſe are thy Gods O Iſrael that brought thee out of Egypt:</hi> that was their Iudgement, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> Politically determining otherwiſe of it, as puniſhable with death, <hi>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 26, 27, 28, 29. did well in it.</p>

            <div type="object">
               <head>Ob.</head>
               <p>True, you will ſay: but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> erred in either thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or ſpeaking ſo.</p>

            <div type="answer">
               <head>Anſ.</head>
               <p>Yea, they did ſo: but ſay we, that was their particular Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though erring: and they as well as we muſt walk in the light of their own judgements, and not of any others (if the objection be right) and therefore according to the objectors mind, ſhould not have been accuſed or puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then all Eccleſiaſticall Judging of men in matters of Religion, which in Iudgement and Conſcience, though er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, men hold forth, is cut off, and why then did <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh that thoſe ſhould bear their Judgement? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 10, 11. ſince many of them held no more, than what they Judged to be right.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Then ſuch mens Iudgements (at leaſt) are not to be a rule to the Chriſtian Magiſtrates Iudgement, but as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his heart, he alſo (as any other Chriſtian) muſt do. If he can make it a matter of his faith, it is no ſin in him, Politically to Iudge, what is, or what is not according to the word, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be civilly puniſhed or praiſed, in Members of the Civil State, when expreſſed in ſuch ſort by the outward man, as it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerneth the State, or reflecteth upon it: and this in matters of both tables, and what then is gained? Nay by this indefinite principle in the objection much would be loſt if the Civil Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate, and State, be in mind perſwaded, and do verily Judge, that the bread in the Sacrament is turned into the very fleſh of Chriſt, &amp; that whoſoever holdeth forth the contrary ſhall be burned at a ſtake, muſt they not do whatſoever they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in their minds? and if of faith to them, then not fin to them to do it, according to the bottom of the objection.</p>
               <p>Nay but you will ſay, their perſwaſion muſt be rightly founded upon the word, which is the object of faith: elſe it is not right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Very good, and in that meaning, your objection is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; unleſs better warrant be ſhewed from the word, why each
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:166430:51"/> mans Judgement, is ſo to be his own guide, that as a Member of the Civill State, his Judgement alſo is not in a Politicall way to be ordered by the Politicall determinations of regulated Civill Authority. As for the ſequels urged: perſecution, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of perſecutors thereby, they are urged from that which is not a proper cauſe, as if it were a cauſe. It is not the uſe of ſuch a power of Judging, in regulated Civill Authority, that cauſeth perſecution for matters of the firſt table, more than tyranny in matters of the ſecond table, but the Abuſe of that power rather: &amp; from the abuſe of a lawfull power or privilege, to reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the uſe thereof, is not right or regular. Churches alſo may abuſe their power, and perſecute a Saint of God, by a wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and anſwerable cenſure, in a matter of God or the Church: but that doth not therefore hinder, but that the Church is higheſt Eccleſiaſticall Judge in ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>The laſt inſtruction from the premiſes; If abuſes in Religion are thus to be reſtrained and puniſhed by regulated Authority, then are not perſons, in an ordinary way, to be left, by regulated Civill Authority, to the liberty of their own judgements, or conſciences, to profeſs or practiſe in matters of Religion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their ſeverall minds and ſpirits, yea though ſeduced and erring, ſhall think meet; no, though thoſe perſons profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, and the fundamentals (at leaſt) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>For the better clearing of this weighty Concluſion, ſo many wayes oppoſed now adayes, we ſhall firſt propound ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions about it; and ſo the better ſtate the Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then let us diſtinguiſh of Liberty, which (according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounds) is either lawfull and regulate liberty, or a liberty that is ſinfull, lawleſs, and boundleſs.</p>
               <p>Lawfull liberty is either that which is of a more civill, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, or mixt nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That of a more civill nature is either oeconomicall, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall properly ſuch; oeconomicall, as that of ſervants, <hi>Ex.</hi> 21. 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 10. or that of wives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 36.

This firſt ſpirituall liberty of each Saint, is not that to which the Concluſion looketh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Spirituall liberty is taken for freeneſs, readineſs, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarineſs to the holy, and good things of God, that what we doe therein, it ſhould be freely, with a ready and willing mind; not as at liberty to do, or not to do any duties required of us, according as we liſt; for that were rather in part licentiouſneſs, a curſed liberty of ſervants to ſin; <hi>When ye were ſervants to ſin,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Spirituall liberty is taken for that which ſtandeth between two extremes, wherein a Chriſtian may be ſayd to be properly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:166430:52"/> free; as when free to chuſe; or refuſe, or ſuſpend, to uſe or doe ſuch or ſuch a thing, or to forbear; And it is Chriſtian liberty ſtrictly taken, or liberty of Chriſtians in matters which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are of an indifferent nature; of which is that place ſo oft applyed too largely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3, 5, 6, 14, 17 Of which nature were the Jewiſh meats and dayes, formerly obſerved, but then aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, although every beleeving Jew was not preſently convinced thereof.</p>
               <p>And here a little to digreſs, let us clear this place ſo often wreſted; that it is meant of things of an indifferent nature in themſelves; this appeareth in that they wcre ſuch things, as whether obſerved or not, the Lord might be exalted, he might be praiſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks:</hi> They were not ſuch things which were not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Morally good, or evill, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>I know there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean of it ſelf;</hi> namely, nothing of that ſort before mentioned, as were Dayes, and Meats, and other like things of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature; elſe it might be ſayd, many things are in themſelves unclean, whether he that dealeth with them think ſo of them or no, as Idolatrous, Adulterous, Murtherous acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> morally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and ſo unclean. They were ſuch things in which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God conſiſted not, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. meats ſacrifiſed to Idols, made not any more or leſs accepted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Meat commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, or if we eat not are we the worſe;</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mixt liberty, which is partly of a ſpirituall, and partly of a civill nature, as it reſpecteth things ſpirituall, wherein it is exerciſed, ſo ſpiritual, as it reſpecteth family authority, by which it is exerciſed, either privately or publiquely, ſo it is of a civill nature, as when the Saints of old had from <hi>Cyrus</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, liberty to goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> freely to build the Temple, <note place="margin">Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Hitherto alſo that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. may partly be referred, and if that were all the liberty which were pleaded for, that by the influence of Civill

               <p>As for that ſinful, lawleſs, and boundleſs liberty, that is a liberty (indeed and reallity) to the fleſh, or the motions and fruits of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, a liberty to ſin, a liberty for men to do what they liſt, and the like, this is it which the Scripture every where decryeth and condemneth, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> So was <hi>Micha</hi>'s Idol, and Idol worſhip, and Miniſtry, right in his eyes, ver 5. 12, 13. <hi>Now I know the Lord will be good to me, ſeeing I have a Levite to my Prieſt.</hi> He verily thought he was right in all, and might look for a bleſſing of God in that way. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>All people will walk every one in the name of his God.</hi> Rom. 6. 10. <hi>Ye were free from righteouſneſs;</hi> and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They promiſe them liberty.</hi> Jude 4, 5. <hi>Turning the grace of God into wantonneſs.</hi> There wanted not ſome in the Apoſtles dayes who would pretend their own, and others ſpirituall liberty, whereby to bring in, and carry on, and covertly to exerciſe this liberty to ſin; and for that end plead liberty from Authorities which ſhould curb or reſtrain ſin; whence that <hi>item</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>As free, but not having for a covering of wickednes the Liberty, but as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, honour all men, love brotherly fellowſhip, fear God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the King.</hi> Whence that bait of Seducers to draw on diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them? they promiſe them liberty, they themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly we diſtinguiſh of conſcience: which is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either as rightly guided, or as miſguided and erring, to Conſcience rightly guided by the Lord, and according to his word, Civill Authority muſt give all incouraging Liberty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Miſguided and erring conſcience is either erring out of meer infirmity and weakneſs; in which caſe great tenderneſs is to be uſed on all hands for a time; or of wilfulneſs, and in way of pertinacy, contempt, and turbulency; of which in the Concluſion.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:166430:53"/> 3. We diſtinguiſh concerning Authoritative leaving perſons to ſome liberty, in abuſes of this Alluſion. It is either a kind of temporary Connivency, or forbearance for a time to puniſh them, which in caſes of weakneſs muſt be granted, till ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means uſed of Conviction; or it is a kind of more fixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, without certain limits of time. This later is ſuppoſed to be; either in ſome caſes of an extraordinary reſpect; as in caſes of Univerſall obduracy, ſpreading over the face of a whole profeſſing State, as was the Toleration of that ſin of cauſleſs Divorces, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a politicall Ruler, for preventing of a worſe miſehief, of inſupportable Tyranny and cruelty over their injured Wives, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 6, 7, 8, 10. <hi>Moſes, for the hardneſs of your hearts, ſuffered you to put away your Wives.—</hi>Or in caſe of ſome Evills, either acted or owned by a more prevailing and potent party, in a Civill State, which if exaſperated and croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would imbrue the State in blood or confuſion; as in the caſe of <hi>Joabs</hi> murther of <hi>Abner,</hi> owned by <hi>Abiſha,</hi> who with their faction, were too ſtrong for <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 39. In which caſe alſo, Godly Emperors have born with ſome Errors, whileſt their State was royled, and the foundations thereof even ſhake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of ſtrong factions and tumults in it. Or ſecondly, this fixed toleration is ſuppoſed to be in an ordinary way, and in common and uſuall caſes, which is that which the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on denyeth.</p>
               <p>Now then to State the concluſion, and accordingly confirm it, we ſay,</p>
               <p>That in ordinary way, a ſet fixed Toleration, is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the Regulated Magiſtrate or higher Civill powers, that their Chriſtian Subjects ſhould hold and profeſs in matters of Religion, what themſelves may pretend conſcience for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; When indeed groſly erring, and contemptuouſly and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly holding the ſame forth.</p>
               <p>Reaſons from ſcripture of the concluſion ſo ſtated, may be theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 1. Becauſe liberty to the fleſh is not to be given in ſuch a way, by ſuch Rulers, for ſuch Rulers, to give ſuch a liberty for all ſuch perſons, to hold and profeſs corrupt opinions, is to give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the fleſh; <hi>Ergo</hi> that may not be done; the propoſition is grounded upon the Rulers duty to keep both Tables, and ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:166430:53"/> not in an ordinary caſe and way, to ſuffer fleſhly ſinfull breaches of the Rules therein. The Aſſumption is grounded upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. Where Hereſie and Schiſm are counted fruits of the fleſh, to give liberty therefore to ſuch fruits of the fleſh, is to give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the fleſh.</p>

That liberty, which ſuffereth men, ordinarily, in a Chriſtian State, to draw perſons away from God, is not to be given by Regulated Rulers thereof; but in ſuch a way, as before mentioned, to tolerate perſons, under pretence of conſcience, pertinaciouſly to hold forth corrupt opinions, is to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to draw away others from God; <hi>Ergo</hi> it may not be done.

               <p>Yes, that which is here injoyned every private perſon, is with reſpect to it, as to be brought before Authority (as it is evident) and if a private perſon be not to let ſuch alone, but to bring him to light, to complain of him to Authority; ſurely that Authority was not to ſpare them, when detected; if Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had been to intreat ſuch, tolerate perſons needed not to be charged not to ſpare them, nor to conceal them; for if they would not forbear them, but complain of them, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate would or might forbear them, theyr non forbearance of them was to litle purpoſe.</p>

Such a liberty mentioned carryeth the mark of an Anarchy in the State, ſo far forth: yea of a ſad Judgement of God upon that State, for provoking ſins of Rulers and people, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it may: the Conſequence is evident, if it carry a mark of Anarchy, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgement, then to be avoyded: unleſſe the very ſhadow of an evill, coming croſſe to the very light and law of nature and Nations, by which all ſhun Anarchy, and ſet up Government, or of that which is commonly the puniſhment of ſin, as deprivall of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, be not to be ſhunned, which none dare affirm. The antecedent is evident in both the branches thereof. 1 It is one brand of an Anarchy, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 6. ſheweth. Then was No King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one did what was right in his own eyes, even the eyes of his own mind, judgement, or conſcience, how corrupt ſoever; hence when through Gods Judgement, that periſhing people of his ſhould not have the benefit of his feeding Government, ſo as to hinder them from ſining, to their ruine, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>I will not feed you, that which dyeth let it dye,</hi> &amp;c. It is accompliſhed by his judiciall breaking of the ſtaffe, <hi>Beauty,</hi> namely both of civil as well as ſacred order, injoyned of God. 2 It is a ſad judgement of God, as that place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 9. 15, 16, 17. compared, doth ſhew, God in judgement is ſaid to let thoſe of the ſinfull people, or flock of his alone to themſelves (as it were) <hi>That which dyeth let it dye,</hi> or let them take ſuch killing courſes of ſin, as tend thereunto. Now the judiciall means he uſeth, is, in judgement to raiſe up a fooliſh Idol Shepheard, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. 17. That is, ſuch kind of Rulers in Church and Common-wealth, Kings (as well as Prieſts) into whoſe hands the Flock is delivered to be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>I will deliver them into the hand of their King,</hi> which though they be by place and office Shepheards, yet in effect are Idols, nothing, no Shepheards; as <hi>Ezek,</hi> 34. 8. 10. he calleth them, of which ſee before, ſuch as ſhall be wholly careleſſe what becommeth of the Flock, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 16. If they be cut off by any ſpirituall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, let them, for them, they will not viſit and look after them; if being young, and ſo weak and unexperienced, they will take any wrong path in ſtead of the right, and ſo looſe themſelves, let them, for them, they will not ſeek their young one: if they be in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure broken in judgement, or otherwiſe, let them be ſo, for them, they will not endeavour to heale them: if any of the Flock yet keep their ſtanding in the fold and paſture of God, they will not cheriſh and encourage them, and by their Authority ſeek to keep them there, they will not feed that which ſtandeth ſtill, they will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:166430:55"/> rather make a prey of them, what they can: <hi>Even the fleſh of the fat,</hi> &amp;c. Such a Shepheard or Ruler (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) who leaveth the Flock, namely to themſelves, he careth not for them, looketh not after them: he hath a ſword upon his eye, or not the uſe of that, even of his wiſdome and parts: and upon his arm, or power, he putteth not forth that. One place more to prove this, that ſo to be left of Authority, to take up Corruption in Religion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Conſcience, this is a ſad judgement of God, for the ſins of a profeſſing people. For this let that place in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 33. be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of. <hi>Howbeit the high places were not taken away, for as yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not prepared their hearts to ſeek the God of their Fathers,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 17. ſeemeth ſomewhat to explain that about the High places, <hi>Nevertheleſſe the people did ſacrifice in the high places, yet to the Lord onely.</hi> Now what theſe High places were where they thus ſacrificed, may be known by comparing Scriptures: namely, ſuch places where they had wont in a manner to ſacrifice to the Lord, before the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> where God allowed his people to ſacrifice before, but after that was built, it became unlawfull to them, and ſinfull, as expreſsly forbidden of God. They had formerly an High place at <hi>Ramah,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Zuph,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> called one of the two <hi>Ramah's</hi> of <hi>Zuphim,</hi> in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that in <hi>Benjamins</hi> Tribe; compare 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 5. 6. 11. 12. there was another High place, where then alſo they lawfully ſacrificed, in <hi>Gibeah</hi> of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> for which ſee and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 5. 12. 13. 14. 26. <hi>Gibeah, Sauls</hi> home, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. even where his Unkle with whom he lived, dwelt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. is the Altar where the high place was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.

Not to mention other places of like uſe for ſacrifice then, as <hi>Gilgal,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 15. but the reaſon of that uſe of High places then allowed of, is given 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 2. only the people ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in High places, becauſe untill thoſe dayes there was no houſe built to the Name of the Lord: but after ſuch a place ſhould be built, where God ſhould place his Name, as was the Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> (as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 29. ſhewes) It was unlawfull, and a breach of rule, in point of Religion and worſhip of God, to ſacrifice elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as it was long before charged in reference to that time, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Offer not thy Burnt-offrings in every place which thou ſeeſt, but at the place which the Lord ſhall chooſe,</hi> &amp;c.

Yea but the people might well enough in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though erring, doe thus much; the places were in <hi>Samuels</hi> time, and others after him, yea in the beginning of <hi>Solomons</hi> time, of good uſe, and God had there accepted ſacrifice, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was far off, they could not be at it morning by morning, as they deſired. Compare 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 28. and <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 4, 5. Yea but the Iſraelites might abuſe that to <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calves: <hi>Anſ:</hi> Be it ſo, but they of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in their High places, ſacrificed to the Lord onely, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 17. and ſo long, will not God accept it? They thought he would. Yea but as ſmall as this corruption might ſeem to be, and as much as they might in conſcience plead for it, it was a corruption in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, croſſe to rules before mentioned, and that they were ſo left to this their liberty, it was Gods juſt hand upon them, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 33. becauſe they had not prepared their hearts to the God of their Fathers, they were ſecurely ſlight in his worſhip, looſe hearted to God-wards, not cordiall and intire to him, and thence they have their deſires and minds in it; their very godly power, that was in many reſpects zealous for God, yet herein through Gods diſpleaſure againſt them for their unheartedneſſe, ſhall leave them to their own liberty. It is in judgement, if they are ſuffered to ſacrifice in ſuch forbidden places, and left to have their own minds therein, &amp; much more, when men have their owne likings in groſſer corruptions, in worſhip through the unfaithfulneſſe of their Civil Rulers, as they of Iſrael had, in <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Gilgal,</hi> in the times of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. It was Gods judgement upon them for their ſins, as <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith God, in judgement againſt them) <hi>to Bethel and tranſgreſſe, and at Gilgal multiply tranſgerſſion, and bring your ſacrifices e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning, &amp;c. for this liketh you O yee children of Iſrael, ſaith the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord God.</hi> One would now think that none that had a heart awfull of Gods diſpleaſure, ſhould ever plead for ſuch a ſad judgement of God, upon themſelves, or others, as to be left to Princes or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to have their own likings in corruptions of Religion.</p>

The Conſequence is undeniable, becauſe if therein not for ſo chief an end of his coming, then not for him: The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is evident: as that ſuch Toleration of ſuch errors, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in Religion, ſo held out, is a like Toleration of the works of the Devil, and <hi>ergo</hi> not a diſſolution and deſtruction of them; the Conſequence is evident, becauſe ſuch a Toleration of the works of the Devil, giveth full ſcope and liberty to them, to have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh operations and energy, cheriſheth them, ſuffereth them to ſpread, and to gather ſtrength in parties, which thereby come to ſide with them, to ſtand and plead for them, to deſpiſe all the Miniſters ſhall ſpeak againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which none will ſay is a way to diſſolve enervate or deſtroy thoſe works of the devil. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evill work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil, Eccl.</hi> 8. 11.

                  </label> that a Chriſtian being bound to attend and follow the dictates of his conſcience, yea though erring, yet he not knowing ſo much, it is to him as rightly guided, and he that would out of any reſpect whatſoever, croſſe the ſuggeſtions of his conſcience, when he at leaſt ſuppoſeth it ſpeaketh right, though really it doe not; would as well croſſe it when it doth ſuggeſt that which is right and truth. Now therefore being bound to follow the ſuggeſtions of his owne Conſcience, if man may reſtrain and puniſh him for this, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he doe follow his conſcience in any way of errour, then man may reſtrain Chriſtians from doing their duty, yea and puniſh them for ſo doing; yea ſince a Chriſtian ſinneth, when he doth or hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing croſſe to his conſcience, though erring: Now muſt a Chriſtian be puniſhed for not ſinning, or becauſe in not forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to doe or hold ſomething againſt his conſcience, he would not ſin? And ſhould he not in ſuch a caſe rather be left to the liberty of his conſcience, and of what his conſcience doth ſo dictate?</p>
               <p>This Objection being of ſome ſeeming weight, for the better clearing the whole, take theſe Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 1. The higheſt Rule, to which all are in conſcience bound,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:166430:59"/> is the very Word of God. Conſcience is to a Chriſtian, <hi>Regula regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> and not <hi>Regula regulans,</hi> which rather is the word; conſcience it ſelfe muſt be ſubject to that: hence it is made the naturall mans ſin, that it is otherwiſe with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>The carnall mind is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.</hi> Hence is it that God layeth Commands upon Conſcience alſo, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 30. the whole ſoule, heart and mind of man, muſt love the Lord, or is by duty bound in its way to expreſſe deareſt, higheſt reſpect to him, even by its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Gods Commandements, in its way, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. <hi>This is love, that we keep his Commandements:</hi> Otherwiſe love ſimply and ſtrictly conſidered, is not appliable to the whole ſoule and mind, but is an affection of the will onely. Now if all the ſoule, minde, and heart muſt doe thus, the conſcience too, which is one faculty thereof. Hence the Law is called ſpirituall, as reaching the ſins of the Spirit, the mind and conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of man alſo, and enjoyning the Spirit its duty, as well as the body and outward man: Hence that writing of Gods Law in his peoples hearts and minds, to be a Soveraigne commanding Law therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. Whatſoever therefore is really contrary to the very Word of God, it muſt needs be ſinfull to him that doth it, as having the form of ſin in it. Sin is (formally) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the tranſgreſſion of the Law, or Word of God; yea albeit the conſcience of him, who holdeth or practiceth that <hi>Anomie</hi> in doctrine or life, doth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough errour, tell him, that it is good and according to the Law or word, for no Creature, and ſo not conſcience it ſelfe by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, can make that which is formally, ſimply, and in its ſelfe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to be other then ſinfull: yea albeit a man ſhould come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſee, and bewaile his errour, and evill, yet the ſin is ſtill in it ſelfe and nature, a ſin, although God in Chriſt, will not impute it to penitent beleivers in Chriſt. Hence expiation of old, made by blood, for ſuch breaches of Gods Commands, when yet the party did not think that they had been ſins, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 17, 18. When a ſoul ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and doth in any of thoſe what is forbidden by Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements [though he wiſt it not] yet he is guilty. Hence Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion made by penitent Saints, of ſins, as ſins, which yet they did out of conſcience and judgement, as duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11. <hi>I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought I ought to doe many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, which thing I alſo did, &amp;c. And being exceeding mad, I perſecuted the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaith it was really in his heart, as duty to him, yet confeſſeth, that it was in deed, and before God, his exceeding madneſſe.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 3. Each ones conſcience therefore is bound to ſuggeſt, that to be held, profeſſed, or practiced, and that onely, which the very written word of God, doth really hold forth, to be ſo held, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, or practiced, and to deter from whatſoever is really contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word, and to that onely; elſe conſcience doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe its boundleſſe reſpects and love to God, which is the firſt and great Commandement of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 4. Each Chriſtian is bound to hearken to the voyce of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thus ſpeaking and ſuggeſting the mind of God, not alone, as that is the word which conſcience doth ſpeak, but as it is the voyce of conſcience, ſo ſpeaking from God. Hence it becometh ſin, if what we doe be not from a good conſciences perſwaſions, grounded upon the very Word of God, the rule and object of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin,</hi> or that which is not grounded upon the Word, which is Faith in the object, and ſuitable perſwaſion built upon the Word, which is Faith in the ſubject, it is ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> 5. Neither Conſcience it ſelfe ſimply conſidered, nor the directing, inſtigating, and perſwading acts of conſcience, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nakedly conſidered, without reſpect to the Word of God, and their conformity thereunto, are an immediate rule approved of God, for Chriſtians to regulate their apprehenſions, or actions thereby; for to make that ſuch a rule of Gods approving, were either,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

And in the Regenerate, it is in part corrupted, and hath a law of ſin in it, as well as any other faculty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. 23. <hi>Paul</hi> a Regenerate man, ſaith, <hi>I am carnall, ſold under ſin,</hi> his whole ſoule alſo as far as yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, was ſold under ſin; and the heart taken for the conſcience, will be ſhewing it ſelfe, in it ſelfe, wicked and deceitfull in ſuch dictates, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. What godly perſon findeth not this guilefull dealing of Conſcience it ſelfe, ſo far as unregenerate; that it will be accuſing when it ſhould excuſe, and excuſing when it ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Whence that of <hi>David,</hi> chiding his ſoule for ſuch like evills, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt downe O my ſoule? and why art thou ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or 2. This at leaſt were to ſuppoſe Conſcience to be fallible (as what other thing can be ſuppoſed of it, as in part unregenerate in the beſt here on earth) Now if ſo, then 1 it is to ſuppoſe, that God
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:166430:60"/> ſhould ſet up to his people a fallible, deceitfull rule. 2. It is to make God the Author of Confuſion in Religion: ſince diverſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſciences, being diverſly led, become diverſe rules, yea (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſuppoſition) approved rules of God: yea then there are approved contradictory rules in Religion: As that no Saints are to be worſhipped with Religious worſhip, according to ſome Chriſtians Conſciences who are Proteſtants: and that Saints are to be ſo worſhipped, according to other Chriſtians conſciences, who are popiſh, that the Lords day is of Divine inſtitution, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome, and that it is not of Divine inſtitution, according to other Chriſtians conſciences. 3. It is to make God the Author and allower of rules, requiring palpable breach of his owne ſacred infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible rules, as Fornication, Heretique-King-killing, plurality of Wives, living without any proper calling, refuſall and neglect of publique and private worſhip of God: ſince the conſciences of too many Chriſtians dictate theſe as meet and lawfull, although the word of God ſpeak the contrary. 4. It is to make God himſelfe to acquit the moſt horrid blaſphemies and hereſies, and other penati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call enormities in Religions of any guilt, ſuppoſing they are, as too often they are, and the objection ſuppoſeth them to be, the dictates of Conſcience, though erring: for then according to this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, they are made to be according to Gods rule, and ſo not irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, not ſins. 5. This were to make God the Author or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that, which too often proveth fatall in the iſſue. For be it that ſometimes ſuch evills mentioned, be no other then ſuch as are right in the eyes of a Chriſtians minde, judgement, and conſcience, yet God ſaith, <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death, Prov.</hi> 11. 12. and 16. 25. 6. This were to cut off all ordinary wayes of conviction and converſion from ſuch as goe aſtray thorough an erring conſcience: For their errours and corrupt wayes being according to conſcience, are by this ſuppoſition according to Gods allowed rule: And would you convert men from following a rule of God? 7. Then in caſe of a more then ordinary converſion from errours and hereſies, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt practices thereof, held in and acted in conſcience formerly, yet are not thoſe errours to be bewailed, or that converſion to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at as of grace, ſince before that converſion ſuch walked according to Gods rule (as it's here ſuppoſed) namely conſciences dictates, though erring: the contrary whereunto is evident in the former inſtance of <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11. confeſſeth that to be his

Doe ſuch perſons, in ſuch omiſſions or commiſſions, their whole duty, but many wayes contrary to their duty, in regard of ſome of which contrary walkings to their duty, they may be juſtly puniſhed for them. In ſome ſence it is a part of duty to doe nothing againſt conſcience, and to doe what one doth according to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet the ſtreſſe and force of that duty lyeth here: becauſe conſcience it ſelfe by duty, is to be ſubject to the word, and bottom all its dictates upon the word, and to attend to all as well as any of the rules of the word; to all which, each man therefore is in conſcience bound to attend: ſo that ſuch erring and corrupted perſons, they doe not their whole, nor doe they their maine duty, in that they doe not therein what is according to the word, but contrary rather to the word, both as requiring firſt ſuch and ſuch duties of them: as for inſtance, to ſwear by the name of God, to goe out to War, and the like, when called to it, under paine of Gods diſpleaſure; and then in a ſecond part, requiring obedience out of conſcience to ſuch or ſuch things, as lawfully required by his Civill Ordinance and Miniſters, even higher Civill powers, and in caſe of doing contrary, leaving them to the dint of his ſword in their hands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. compared. 2. Since in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (mentioned) of their erring conſciences, whilſt erring, they offend their conſcience, if they ſhould then reſolve againſt the doing of ſomething in it ſelfe evill, they may and ſhould take a middle courſe rather at preſent; namely, to uſe all the beſt means of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:166430:62"/> better information of their erring minds, that ſo they may refuſe to act or hold: not where an erring conſcience requireth, or on the other hand, may doe, not what an erring conſcience then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth, but what the ſame conſcience upon better ſight, ſeeth cauſe to refuſe to doe, or elſe to doe; as in the former inſtances of taking an Oath, going to War (to which we may add) putting away a wife upon a ſlight cauſe, or the like: they will not ſtiffly refuſe an Oath, or to goe for a ſouldier when Authority lawfully requireth it, nor yet forthwith actually doe it, but humbly deſire time and help to be cleared in the lawfulneſſe of it, and afterwards give in their Anſwer, and accordingly ſeriouſly and conſcionably uſing the beſt means, uſually and ordinarily accompanied with the Lords ſpeciall bleſſing, they groundedly doe what is required. So in caſe of ſuch putting away a wife, to which erring conſcience urgeth, they reſolve not wholly to forbear ſuch a thing, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuſpend, upon deſire of the beſt information, which attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they forbear now upon a well informed Conſcience, what they durſt not have wholly refuſed in the former ſtate of their erring Conſcience. Now if ſuch perſons, through pride, wilfulneſſe, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorineſſe, contempt, falſhood, or falſe conceit, will refuſe the due and reall uſe of ſuch means, and of the ordinary way of God, to help them out of this Labyrinth, they refuſe a manifeſt, knowne duty, and expoſe themſelves the rather to Civil Juſtice.</p>
